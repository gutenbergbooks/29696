<h2>I</h2>
<h3>NICHOLAS TOP</h3>
</div>
<p>My uncle, Nicholas Top, of Twist Tickle, was of
a cut so grotesque that folk forgot their manners
when he stumped abroad. Bowling through the
streets of St. John&#8217;s, which twice a year he tapped with
staff and wooden leg, myself in leading&ndash;&ndash;bowling
cheerily, with his last rag spread, as he said, and be
damned to the chart&ndash;&ndash;he left a swirling wake of amazement:
craning necks, open mouths, round eyes, grins so
frank, the beholders being taken unaware, that &#8217;twas
simple to distinguish hearts of pity from savage ones.</p>
<p>Small wonder they stared; my uncle was a broad,
long-bodied, scowling, grim-lipped runt, with the arms
and chest of an ape, a leg lacking, three fingers of the
left hand gone at the knuckles, an ankle botched in the
mending (the surgery his own), a jaw out of place, a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
round head set low between gigantic shoulders upon a
thick neck: the whole forever clad in a fantastic miscellany
of water-side slops, wrinkled above, where he
was large, flapping below, where he was lean, and
chosen with a nautical contempt for fit and fashion, but
with a mysteriously perverse regard for the value of a
penny.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; how much, lad,&#8221; says he, in the water-side slop-shops,
&#8220;is a penny saved?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas strange that of all men he should teach me
this old-fashioned maxim as though &#8217;twere meant for
my own practice. &#8217;Twas well enough for him, it
seemed; but &#8217;twas an incumbrance of wisdom in the
singular case of the lad that was I.</p>
<p>&#8220;A penny made, sir,&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Co&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;rect!&#8221; says he, with satisfaction.</p>
<p>There was more to be wondered at: beginning at my
uncle&#8217;s left ear, which was itself sadly puckered and
patched, a wide, rough scar, of changing color, as his
temper went, cut a great swath in his wiry hair, curving
clear over the crown of his head. A second scar, of
lesser dimension and ghastly look, lay upon his forehead,
over the right eyebrow, to which though by
nature drooping to a glower, it gave a sharp upward
twist, so that in a way to surprise the stranger he
was in good humor or bad, cynical or sullen, according
to the point of approach.</p>
<p>There were two rolls of flabby flesh under his chin,
and a puff of fat under each of his quick little eyes;
and from the puffs to the lower chin, which was half
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
submerged in the folds of a black cravat, the broad,
mottled expanse was grown wild with short gray beard,
save where, on the left cheek, a ragged scar (the third)
kept it bare and livid. &#8217;Twas plain the man had
blundered into some quarrel of wind and sea, whence
he had been indifferently ejected, in the way of
the sea, to live or die, as might chance: whereof&ndash;&ndash;doubtless
to account for his possession of me&ndash;&ndash;he
would tell that my father had been lost in the adventure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Swep&#8217; away by the third big sea,&#8221; says he, his
face wan with the terror of that time, his body shrunk
in the chair and so uneasy that I was moved against
my will to doubt the tale. &#8220;May God A&#8217;mighty forgive
un the deed he done!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was it a sore, wicked thing my father did?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;God forgive un&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is you sure, Uncle Nick?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;God forgive un!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not likin&#8217; my poor father,&#8221; I complained,
&#8220;for the sinful thing he done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis a sinful wicked world us dwells in,&#8221; says he.
&#8220;An&#8217; I &#8217;low, b&#8217;y,&#8221; says he, in anxious warning, &#8220;that
afore you goes t&#8217; bed the night.... Pass the bottle.
Thank &#8217;e, lad ... that afore you goes t&#8217; bed the night
you&#8217;d best get a new grip on that there little anchor
I&#8217;ve give ye t&#8217; hang to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; what&#8217;s that?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;The twenty-third psa&#8217;m,&#8221; says he, his bottle tipped,
&#8220;for safety!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span></div>
<p>My uncle would have (as he said) no dealings with
a glass. There was none in the places familiar to his
eyes; and when by chance, in the tap-rooms of the
city, he came face to face with himself, he would start
away with a fervent malediction upon the rogue in the
mirror, consigning him to perdition without hope of
passage into some easier state.</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas anathema most feeling and complete.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hist!&#8221; cries I. &#8220;You&#8217;re never so bad as <i>that</i>,
Uncle Nick!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;None worse,&#8221; says he, &#8220;than that there ol&#8217; lost
rascal!&#8221;</p>
<p>I did not believe it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I isn&#8217;t took a steady look at my ol&#8217; figger-&#8217;ead,&#8221; he
was used to saying, with his little eyes widened to excite
wonder, &#8220;this five year! In p&#8217;int o&#8217; looks,&#8221; says he,
smirking, vain as you please, &#8220;I&#8217;m t&#8217; windward o&#8217; most
o&#8217; the bullies when I trims my beard. Ah, lad, they&#8217;s a
raft o&#8217; bar-maids an&#8217; water-side widows would wed ol&#8217;
Nicholas Top. An&#8217; why? &#8217;Tain&#8217;t money, God knows!
for Nicholas Top haves none. Nar a dollar that a lone
water-side widow could nose out! An&#8217; if &#8217;tisn&#8217;t money,&#8221;
says he, &#8220;why, Lord love us! &#8217;tis <i>looks</i>. It can&#8217;t be
nothin&#8217; else. &#8217;Tis looks or money with the widows;
they cares not which. Come, now, lad,&#8221; says he,
&#8220;would you &#8217;low it <i>could</i> be otherwise than looks?&#8221;</p>
<p>I must wag my head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord love us, Dannie!&#8221; says he, so vain&ndash;&ndash;so innocently
vain of the face he would not see&ndash;&ndash;that my lips
twitch with laughter to think of it. &#8220;You an&#8217; them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
water-side widows is got a wonderful judgment for
looks!&#8221;</p>
<p>By this I was flattered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, look you!&#8221; says he, being now in his cups and
darkly confidential with me, &#8220;I&#8217;m havin&#8217;, as I says, no
dealin&#8217; with a glass. An&#8217; why? Accordin&#8217; t&#8217; the water-side
widows &#8217;tis not ill-favor o&#8217; face. Then why? I&#8217;m
tellin&#8217; you: &#8217;Tis just because,&#8221; says he, tapping the
table with his forefinger, &#8220;Nick Top isn&#8217;t able t&#8217; look
hisself in the eye.... Pass the bottle. Thank &#8217;e,
lad.... There you haves it!&#8221; says he, with a pitiful
little catch of the breath. &#8220;Nicholas Top haves a
wonderful bad eye!&#8221;</p>
<p>I must nod my assent and commiseration.</p>
<p>&#8220;In p&#8217;int o&#8217; beauty,&#8221; says my uncle, &#8220;Nicholas Top
is perfeckly content with the judgment o&#8217; water-side
widows, which can&#8217;t be beat; but for these five year,
Lord help un! he&#8217;ve had no love for the eye in his
very own head.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas said in such chagrin and depth of sadness that
I was moved to melancholy.</p>
<p>&#8220;His own eye, lad,&#8221; he would repeat, &#8220;in his very
own head!&#8221;</p>
<p>My uncle, I confess, had indeed a hint too much of
the cunning and furtive about both gait and glance to
escape remark in strange places. &#8217;Twas a pity&ndash;&ndash;and
a mystery. That he should hang his head who might
have held it high! At Twist Tickle, to be sure, he
would hop hither and yon in a fashion surprisingly
light (and right cheerful); but abroad &#8217;twas either
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
swagger or slink. Upon occasions &#8217;twas manifest to
all the world that following evil he walked in shame
and terror. These times were periodic, as shall be
told: wherein, because of his simplicity, which was
unspoiled&ndash;&ndash;whatever the rascality he was in the way
of practising&ndash;&ndash;he would betray the features of hang-dog
villany, conceiving all the while that he had cleverly
masked himself with virtue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Child,&#8221; says he, in that high gentleness by which
he was distinguished, &#8220;take the old man&#8217;s hand. Never
fear t&#8217; clasp it, lad! Ye&#8217;re abroad in respectable company.&#8221;</p>
<p>I would clasp it in childish faith.</p>
<p>&#8220;Abroad,&#8221; says he, defiantly, &#8220;in highly respectable
company!&#8221;</p>
<p>Ah, well! whether rogue or gentleman, upon whom
rascality was writ, the years were to tell. These, at
any rate, were the sinister aspects of Nicholas Top, of
Twist Tickle, whose foster-child I was, growing in
such mystery as never was before, I fancy, and thriving
in love not of the blood but rich and anxious as
love may be: and who shall say that the love which is
of the blood&ndash;&ndash;a dull thing, foreordained&ndash;&ndash;is more discerning,
more solicitous, more deep and abiding than
that which chances, however strangely, in the turmoil
and changes of the life we live? To restore confidence,
the old dog was furnished with an ample, genial belly;
and albeit at times he drank to excess, and despite the
five years&#8217; suspicion of the eye in his very own head,
his eyes were blue and clear and clean-edged, with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
little lights of fun and tenderness and truth twinkling
in their depths. I would have you know that as a
child I loved the scarred and broken old ape: this with
a child&#8217;s devotion, the beauty of which (for &#8217;tis the way
of the heart) is not to be matched in later years, whatever
may be told. Nor in these days, when I am full-grown
and understand, will I have a word spoken in his
dishonor.</p>
<p>Not I, by Heaven!</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>I came to Twist Tickle, as I am informed, on the
wings of a southeasterly gale: which winds are of mean
spirit and sullenly tenacious&ndash;&ndash;a great rush of ill weather,
overflowing the world, blowing gray and high and cold.
At sea &#8217;twas breaking in a geyser of white water on the
Resurrection Rock; and ashore, in the meagre shelter
of Meeting House Hill, the church-bell clanged fearsomely
in a swirl of descending wind: the gloaming of
a wild day, indeed! The <i>Shining Light</i> came lurching
through the frothy sea with the wind astern: a flash
of white in the mist, vanishing among the careering
waves, doughtily reappearing&ndash;&ndash;growing the while into
the stature of a small craft of parts, making harbor
under a black, tumultuous sky. Beyond the Toads,
where there is a turmoil of breaking water, she made
a sad mess of it, so that the folk of the Tickle, watching
the strange appearance from the heads, made sure she
had gone down; but she struggled out of the spray
and tumble, in the end, and came to harbor unscathed
in the place where Nicholas Top, himself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
the skipper and crew, was born and fished as a
lad.</p>
<p>They boarded him, and (as they tell) he was brisk
and grim and dripping upon the deck&ndash;&ndash;with the lights
dancing in his eyes: those which are lit by the mastery
of a ship at sea.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, mates,&#8221; says he, &#8220;I&#8217;m come back. An&#8217;,&#8221; says
he, &#8220;I&#8217;d thank ye t&#8217; tread lightly, for I&#8217;ve a wee passenger
below, which I&#8217;ve no wish t&#8217; have woke. He&#8217;s by
way o&#8217; bein&#8217; a bit of a gentleman,&#8221; says he, &#8220;an&#8217; I&#8217;d
not have ye take a liberty.&#8221;</p>
<p>This made them stare.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; I&#8217;d not,&#8221; my uncle repeated, steadily, glancing
from eye to eye, &#8220;have ye take a liberty.&#8221;</p>
<p>They wondered the more.</p>
<p>&#8220;A bit of a gentleman!&#8221; says my uncle, in savage
challenge. &#8220;A bit of a gentleman!&#8221;</p>
<p>He would tell them no more, nor ever did; but in
imperturbable serenity and certainty of purpose builded
a tight little house in a nook of Old Wives&#8217; Cove, within
the harbor, where the <i>Shining Light</i> might lie snug;
and there he dwelt with the child he had, placidly
fishing the grounds with hook and line, save at such
times as he set out upon some ill-seeming business to
the city, whence he returned at ease, it seemed, with
himself and his errand, but something grayer, they
say, than before. The child he reared was in the
beginning conscious of no incongruity, but clothed the
old man with every grace and goodly quality, in faith
and understanding, as children will: for these knowing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
ones, with clearer sight than we, perceive neither guile
nor weakness nor any lack of beauty in those who foster
them&ndash;&ndash;God be thanked!&ndash;&ndash;whatever the nature and
outward show may be. There is a beauty common to
us all, neither greater nor less in any of us, which these
childish hearts discover. Looking upon us, they are
blind or of transcendent vision, as you will: the same
in issue&ndash;&ndash;so what matter?&ndash;&ndash;since they find no ugliness
anywhere. &#8217;Tis the way, it may be, that God looks
upon His world: either in the blindness of love forgiving
us or in His greater wisdom knowing that the sins of
men do serve His purpose and are like virtue in His
plan.</p>
<p>But this is a mystery....</p>

<h2>II</h2>
<h3>AT THE SIGN OF THE ANCHOR AND CHAIN</h3>
</div>
<p>The Anchor and Chain is a warm, pleasantly noisy
place by the water-side at St. John&#8217;s, with a not
ungrateful reek of rum and tobacco for such outport
folk as we; forever filled, too, with big, twinkling,
trumpeting men, of our simple kind, which is the sort
the sea rears. There for many a mellow hour of the
night was I perched upon a chair at my uncle&#8217;s side,
delighting in the cheer which enclosed me&ndash;&ndash;in the pop
of the cork, the inspiriting passage of the black bottle,
the boisterous talk and salty tales, the free laughter&ndash;&ndash;but
in which I might not yet, being then but seven
years old, actively partake.</p>
<p>When in the first of it my uncle called for his dram,
he would never fail to catch the bar-maid&#8217;s hand,
squeeze it under the table, with his left eyelid falling
and his displaced jaw solemnly ajar, informing her the
while, behind his thumb and forefinger, the rest of
that hand being gone, that I was a devil of a teetotaler:
by which (as I thought, and, I&#8217;ll be bound, he
knew well I would think) my years were excused and
I was admitted to the company of whiskered skippers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
upon a footing of equality. &#8217;Tis every man&#8217;s privilege,
to be sure, to drink rum or not, as he will, without loss
of dignity.</p>
<p>If his mates would have me drink a glass with them
my uncle would not hinder.</p>
<p>&#8220;A nip o&#8217; ginger-ale,&#8221; says I, brash as a sealing-captain.</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas the despair of my uncle. &#8220;Lord love us!&#8221;
says he, looking with horror upon the bottle.</p>
<p>&#8220;T&#8217; you, sir,&#8221; says I, with my glass aloft, &#8220;an&#8217; t&#8217; the
whole bally crew o&#8217; ye!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Belly-wash!&#8221; groans my uncle.</p>
<p>And so, brave and jolly as the rest of them, forgetting
the doses of jalap in store for me when I was got
back to the Tickle, I would now have my ninny (as
they called it). Had the bar-maids left off kissing me&ndash;&ndash;but
they would not; no, they would kiss me upon
every coming, and if I had nothing to order &#8217;twas a
kiss for my virtue, and if I drank &#8217;twas a smack for
my engaging manliness; and my only satisfaction was
to damn them heartily&ndash;&ndash;under my breath, mark you!
lest I be soundly thrashed on the spot for this profanity,
my uncle, though you may now misconceive his character,
being in those days quick to punish me. But
such are women: in a childless place, being themselves
childless, they cannot resist a child, but would kiss
queer lips, and be glad o&#8217; the chance, because a child
is lovely to women, intruding where no children are.</p>
<p>As a child of seven I hated the bar-maids of the
Anchor and Chain, because they would kiss me against
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
my will when the whiskered skippers went untouched.
But that was long ago....</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>I must tell that at the Anchor and Chain my uncle
blundered in with Tom Bull, of the <i>Green Billow</i>, the
owner and skipper thereof, trading the ports of the
West Coast, then coast-wise, but (I fancy) not averse
to a smuggling opportunity, both ways, with the French
Islands to the south of us; at any rate, &#8217;twas plain,
before the talk was over, that he needed no lights to
make the harbor of St.-Pierre, Miquelon, of a dark
time. &#8217;Twas a red-whiskered, flaring, bulbous-nosed
giant, with infantile eyes, containing more of wonder
and patience than men need. He was clad in yellow
oil-skins, a-drip, glistening in the light of the lamps,
for he was newly come in from the rain: a bitter night,
the wind in the northeast, with a black fog abroad (I
remember it well)&ndash;&ndash;a wet, black night, the rain driving
past the red-curtained windows of the Anchor and
Chain, the streets swept clean of men, ourselves light-hearted
and warm, indifferent, being ashore from the
wind, the cloudy night, the vicious, crested waves of
the open, where men must never laugh nor touch a
glass.</p>
<p>They must have a dram together in a stall removed
from the congregation of steaming men at the long
bar. And when the maid had fetched the bottle, Tom
Bull raised it, regarded it doubtfully, cocked his head,
looked my shamefaced uncle in the eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; what might this be?&#8221; says he.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span></div>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis knowed hereabouts, in the langwitch o&#8217; waterside
widows,&#8221; replies my uncle, mildly, &#8220;as a bottle o&#8217;
Cheap an&#8217; Nasty.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom Bull put the bottle aside.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Tis</i> cheap, I&#8217;ll be bound,&#8221; says my uncle; &#8220;but
&#8217;tis not so wonderful nasty, Tom,&#8221; he grieved, &#8220;when
&#8217;tis the best t&#8217; be had.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Skipper Nicholas,&#8221; says Tom, in wonder, &#8220;wasn&#8217;t
you give aforetime t&#8217; the use o&#8217; Long Tom?&#8221;</p>
<p>My uncle nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear man!&#8221; Tom Bull sighed.</p>
<p>My uncle looked away. Tom Bull seemed now first
to observe his impoverished appearance, and attacked
it with frankly curious eyes, which roamed without
shame over my uncle&#8217;s shrinking person; and my uncle
winced under this inquisition.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pour your liquor,&#8221; growls he, &#8220;an&#8217; be content!&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom Bull grasped the bottle, unafraid of the contents,
unabashed by the rebuke. &#8220;An&#8217; Skipper Nicholas,&#8221;
asks he, &#8220;where did you manage t&#8217; pick up the young
feller?&#8221;</p>
<p>My uncle would not attend.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221; Tom Bull persisted. &#8220;Where did you come
across o&#8217; he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This,&#8221; says my uncle, with a gentle tug at my ear,
&#8220;is Dannie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay; but whose young one?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom Callaway&#8217;s son.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom Callaway&#8217;s son!&#8221; cries Tom Bull.</p>
<p>There was that about me to stir surprise; with those
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
generous days so long gone by, I will not gainsay it.
Nor will I hold Tom Bull in fault for doubting, though
he stared me, up and down, until I blushed and turned
uneasy while his astonished eyes were upon me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom Callaway&#8217;s son!&#8221; cries he again.</p>
<p>That I was.</p>
<p>&#8220;The same,&#8221; says my uncle.</p>
<p>Forthwith was I once more inspected, without reserve&ndash;&ndash;for
a child has no complaint to make in such
cases&ndash;&ndash;and with rising wonder, which, in the end,
caused Tom Bull to gape and gasp; but I was now less
concerned with the scrutiny, being, after all, long used
to the impertinence of the curious, than with the phenomena
it occasioned. My uncle&#8217;s friend had tipped
the bottle, and was now become so deeply engaged
with my appearance that the yellow whiskey tumbled
into his glass by fits and starts, until the allowance was
far beyond that which, upon information supplied me
by my uncle, I deemed proper (or polite) for any man
to have at one time. The measurement of drams was
in those bibulous days important to me&ndash;&ndash;of much more
agreeable interest, indeed, than the impression I was
designed to make upon the &#8217;longshore world.</p>
<p>&#8220;No such nonsense!&#8221; exclaims Tom Bull. &#8220;Tom
Callaway died &#8217;ithout a copper t&#8217; bury un.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom Callaway,&#8221; says my uncle, evasively, &#8220;didn&#8217;t
have no <i>call</i> t&#8217; be buried; he was drown-ded.&#8221;</p>
<p>My uncle&#8217;s old shipmate sipped his whiskey with
absent, but grateful, relish, his eyes continuing to
wander over so much of me as grew above the table,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
which was little enough. Presently my uncle was subjected
to the same severe appraisement, and wriggled
under it in guilty way&ndash;&ndash;an appraisement of the waterside
slops: the limp and shabby cast-off apparel which
scantily enveloped his great chest, insufficient for the
bitter rain then sweeping the streets. Thence the glance
of this Tom Bull went blankly over the foggy room,
pausing nowhere upon the faces of the folk at the bar,
but coming to rest, at last, upon the fly-blown rafters
(where was no interest), whence, suddenly, it dropped
to my hand, which lay idle and sparkling upon the
sticky table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom Callaway&#8217;s son!&#8221; he mused.</p>
<p>My hand was taken, spread down upon the calloused
palm of Tom Bull, in disregard of my frown, and for a
long time the man stared in puzzled silence at what
there he saw. &#8217;Twas very still, indeed, in the little
stall where we three sat; the boisterous laughter, the
shuffling and tramp of heavy boots, the clink of glasses,
the beating of the rain upon the windows seemed far
away.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d not be s&#8217;prised,&#8221; says Tom Bull, in the low,
hoarse voice of awe, &#8220;if them there was di&#8217;monds!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They is,&#8221; says my uncle, with satisfaction.</p>
<p>&#8220;Di&#8217;monds!&#8221; sighs Tom Bull. &#8220;My God!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas boredom&ndash;&ndash;the intimate inspection, the question,
the start of surprise. &#8217;Twas all inevitable, so
familiar&ndash;&ndash;so distastefully intrusive, too. &#8217;Twas a boredom
hard to suffer, and never would have been borne
had not the occasion of it been my uncle&#8217;s delight.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
&#8217;Twas always the same: Diamonds? ay, diamonds!
and then the gasped &#8220;My God!&#8221; They would pry
into this, by the Lord! and never be stopped by my
scowl and the shrinking of my flesh. It may be that
the parade my misguided guardian made of me invited
the intimacy, and, if so, I have no cry to raise against
the memory of it; but, whatever, they made free with
the child that was I, and boldly, though &#8217;twas most
boresome and ungrateful to me. As a child my hand
was fingered and eyed by every &#8217;longshore jack, coast-wise
skipper, and foreign captain from the Turkey
Cock to the sign of The King George. And wherever
I went upon the streets of St. John&#8217;s in those days there
was no escape: the glitter of me stopped folk in their
tracks&ndash;&ndash;to turn and stare and wonder and pass muttering
on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Three in that one, Tom,&#8221; adds my uncle.</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas a moment before Tom Bull had mastered his
amazement. &#8220;Well, well!&#8221; cries he. &#8220;Di&#8217;monds!
Three in that one! Lord, Lord, think o&#8217; that! This
wee feller with all them di&#8217;monds! An&#8217; Skipper Nicholas,&#8221;
says he, drawing closer to my beaming uncle,
&#8220;this here red stone,&#8221; says he, touching the ring on my
third finger, &#8220;would be a jool? A ruby, like as not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis that,&#8221; says my uncle.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; this here?&#8221; Tom Bull continues, selecting my
little finger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now, Tom,&#8221; says my uncle, with gusto, for
he delighted in these discussions, &#8220;I &#8217;low I better tell
you &#8217;bout that. Ye see, lad,&#8221; says he, &#8220;that&#8217;s a seal-ring,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
Tom. I&#8217;m told that gentlemen wears un t&#8217; stamp
the wax o&#8217; their corr-ee-spondence. &#8217;Twas Sir Harry
that give me the trick o&#8217; that. It haves a D for Daniel,
an&#8217; a C for Callaway; an&#8217; it haves a T in the middle,
Tom, for Top. I &#8217;lowed I&#8217;d get the Top in somewheres,
so I put it in atween the D an&#8217; the C t&#8217; have
it lie snug: for I&#8217;m not wantin&#8217; this here little Dannie
t&#8217; forget that Top was t&#8217; the wheel in his younger
days.&#8221; He turned to me, and in a voice quite broken
with affection, and sadly hopeless, somehow, as I
recall, &#8220;Dannie, lad,&#8221; says he, &#8220;ye&#8217;ll never forget,
will ye, that Top was t&#8217; the wheel? God bless ye,
child! Well, Tom,&#8221; turning now to his shipmate,
&#8220;ye&#8217;re a man much sailed t&#8217; foreign parts, an&#8217; ye
wouldn&#8217;t think it ungenteel, would ye, for a lad like
Dannie t&#8217; wear a seal-ring? No? I&#8217;m wonderful glad
o&#8217; that. For, Tom,&#8221; says he, most earnestly, &#8220;I&#8217;m
wantin&#8217; Dannie t&#8217; be a gentleman. He&#8217;s just <i>got</i> t&#8217; be
a gentleman!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A gentleman, Nick?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ve <i>got</i> t&#8217; be a gentleman!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll never manage that, Nick Top,&#8221; says Tom
Bull.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not manage it!&#8221; my uncle indignantly complained.
&#8220;Why, look, Tom Bull&ndash;&ndash;jus&#8217; <i>look</i>&ndash;&ndash;at them there jools!
An&#8217; <i>that&#8217;s</i> on&#8217;y a poor beginnin&#8217;!&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom Bull laid my hand very gingerly upon the
table, as though &#8217;twere a thing not lightly to be handled
lest it fall to pieces in his grasp. He drew my left hand
from my pocket and got it under the light.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Two pearls,&#8221; says my uncle, &#8220;&#8217;longside a emerald.
Aft o&#8217; that you&#8217;ll be like t&#8217; find two more di&#8217;monds.
Them&#8217;s first-water Brazil, Tom.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom Bull inquiringly touched my watch-guard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eighteen karat,&#8221; says my uncle.</p>
<p>Tom Bull drew the watch from its pocket and let it
lie glittering in his hand; the jewels, set shyly in the
midst of the chasing, glowed in the twilight of the
stall.</p>
<p>&#8220;Solid,&#8221; says my uncle.</p>
<p>Tom Bull touched my velvet jacket with the tip of
his finger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Imported direck,&#8221; says my uncle, &#8220;from Lon&#8217;on.
Direck, Tom&ndash;&ndash;is you hearin&#8217; me?&ndash;&ndash;direck from Lon&#8217;on.
Not,&#8221; says he, with quick consideration, &#8220;that we&#8217;ve
no respeck for home talent. My, my, no! Dannie
haves a matter o&#8217; thirteen outfits done right here in
St. John&#8217;s. You beat about Water Street for a
week, Tom, an&#8217; you&#8217;ll <i>sight</i> un. Fill your glass, Tom!
We&#8217;re well met this night. Leave me talk t&#8217; you, lad.
Leave me talk t&#8217; ye about Dannie. Fill up, an&#8217; may
the Lord prosper your smugglin&#8217;! &#8217;Tis a wild night
without. I&#8217;m glad enough t&#8217; be in harbor. &#8217;Tis a
dirty night; but &#8217;tis not blowin&#8217; <i>here</i>, Tom&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; that&#8217;s
the bottle; pour your dram, lad, an&#8217; take it like a
man! God save us! but a bottle&#8217;s the b&#8217;y t&#8217; make a
fair wind of a head wind. Tom,&#8221; says he, laying a
hand on my head&ndash;&ndash;which was the ultimate expression
of his affection&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;you jus&#8217; ought t&#8217; clap eyes on this
here little ol&#8217; Dannie when he&#8217;ve donned his Highland
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
kilts. He&#8217;s a little divil of a dandy then, I&#8217;m tellin&#8217;
you. Never a lad o&#8217; the city can match un, by the
Lord! Not match my little Dannie! Clap eyes,&#8221; says
he, &#8220;on good ol&#8217; little Dannie! Lord save ye, but
of all the young fellers you&#8217;ve knowed he&#8217;s the finest
figger of a lad&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Nick!&#8221; I cried, in pain&ndash;&ndash;in pain to be excused
(as shall be told).</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush, lad!&#8221; croons he. &#8220;Never mind!&#8221;</p>
<p>I could not help it.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; talkin&#8217; about outfits, Tom,&#8221; says my uncle,
&#8220;this here damn little ol&#8217; Dannie, bein&#8217; a gentleman,
haves his <i>best</i>&ndash;&ndash;from Lon&#8217;on. Ye can&#8217;t blame un,
Tom; they <i>all</i> doos it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas all hands t&#8217; the pumps for poor Tom Bull.
&#8220;Dear man!&#8221; he gasped, his confusion quite accomplished.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; <i>paid</i> for,&#8221; says my uncle.</p>
<p>Tom Bull looked up.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis all,&#8221; says my uncle, solemnly jerking thumb
down towards the bowels of the earth, &#8220;paid for!&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom Bull gulped the dregs of his whiskey.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>By-and-by, having had his glass&ndash;&ndash;and still with the
puzzle of myself to mystify his poor wits&ndash;&ndash;Tom Bull
departed. My uncle and I still kept to the stall, for
there was an inch of spirits in my uncle&#8217;s glass, and
always, though the night was late and stormy, a large
possibility for new company. &#8217;Twas grown exceeding
noisy in a far corner of the place, where a foreign
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
captain, in from the north (Fogo, I take it), loaded
with fish for Italian ports, was yielding to his liquor;
and I was intent upon this proceeding, wondering
whether or not they would soon take to quarrelling,
as often happened in that tap-room, when Tom Bull
softly came again, having gone but a step beyond the
threshold of the place. He stepped, as though aimlessly,
to our place, like a man watched, fearing the
hand of the law; and for a time he sat musing, toying
with the glass he had left.</p>
<p>&#8220;Skipper Nicholas,&#8221; says he, presently, &#8220;I &#8217;low
Dannie Callaway haves a friend t&#8217; buy un all them
jools?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This here little ol&#8217; Dannie,&#8221; says my uncle, with
another little reassuring tug at my ear, &#8220;haves no
friend in all the world but me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas true.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not one?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nar a friend in all the world but ol&#8217; Nick Top o&#8217;
Twist Tickle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; <i>you</i> give un them jools?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a pause. Tom Bull was distraught, my
uncle quivering; and I was interested in the rain on
the panes and in the foreign captain who was yielding
to his liquor like a fool or a half-grown boy. I conceived
a contempt for that shaven, scrawny skipper&ndash;&ndash;I
remember it well. That he should drink himself
drunk like a boy unused to liquor! Faugh! &#8217;Twas
a sickening sight. He would involve himself in some

drunken brawl, I made sure, when even I, a child,
knew better than to misuse the black bottle in this
unkind way. &#8217;Twas the passage from Spain&ndash;&ndash;and the
rocks of this and the rocks of that&ndash;&ndash;and &#8217;twas the
virtues of a fore-and-after and the vices of an English
square rig for the foremast. He&#8217;d stand by the square
rig; and there were Newfoundlanders at his table to
dispute the opinion. The good Lord only knew what
would come of it! And the rain was on the panes, and
the night was black, and the wind was playing devil-tricks
on the great sea, where square-rigged foremasts
and fore-and-afters were fighting for their lives. A
dirty night at sea&ndash;&ndash;a dirty night, God help us!</p>
<p>&#8220;Skipper Nicholas,&#8221; says Tom Bull, in an anxious
whisper, &#8220;I&#8217;m tied up t&#8217; Judby&#8217;s wharf, bound out at
dawn, if the wind holds. I &#8217;low you is in trouble, lad,
along o&#8217; them jools. An&#8217; if you wants t&#8217; cut an&#8217; run&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>In the pause my uncle scowled.</p>
<p>&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;The little <i>Good Omen</i>,&#8221; says Tom Bull, under
his breath, &#8220;is your&#8217;n t&#8217; command!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas kind of intention, no doubt, but done in folly&ndash;&ndash;in
stupid (if not befuddled) misconception of the old
man&#8217;s mettle. My uncle sat quite still, frowning into
his glass; the purple color crept into the long, crescent
scar of his scalp, his unkempt beard bristled like a
boar&#8217;s back, the flesh of his cheeks, in composure of a
ruddy hue, turned a spotty crimson and white, with
the web of veins swelling ominously. All the storm
signals I had, with the acumen of the child who suffers
unerring discipline, mastered to that hour were at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
mast-head, prognosticating a rare explosion of rage.
But there was no stirring on my uncle&#8217;s part; he continued
to stare into his glass, with his hairy brows
drawn quite over his eyes.</p>
<p>The blundering fellow leaned close to my uncle&#8217;s ear.
&#8220;If &#8217;tis turn-tail or chokee for you, along o&#8217; them
jools,&#8221; says he, &#8220;I&#8217;ll put you across&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>My uncle&#8217;s eyes shifted to his staff.</p>
<p>&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;T&#8217; the Frenchmen&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>My uncle&#8217;s great right hand was softly approaching
his staff.</p>
<p>&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;Well,&#8221; says the blundering Tom Bull, &#8220;give the
old girl a wind with some slap to it, I&#8217;ll put you across
in&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>My uncle fetched him a smart crack on the pate, so
that the man leaped away, in indignation, and vigorously
rubbed his head, but durst not swear (for he
was a Methodist), and, being thus desperately situated,
could say nothing at all, but could only petulantly
whimper and stamp his foot, which I thought a mean
thing for a man to do in such circumstances. &#8220;A
poor way,&#8221; says he, at last, &#8220;t&#8217; treat an old shipmate!&#8221;
I thought it marvellously weak; my uncle would have
had some real and searching thing to say&ndash;&ndash;some slashing
words (and, may be, a blow). &#8220;An you isn&#8217;t a
thief,&#8221; cries Tom Bull, in anger, &#8220;you <i>looks</i> it, anyhow.
An&#8217; the rig o&#8217; that lad bears me out. Where&#8217;d
you come by them jools? Eh?&#8221; he demanded.
&#8220;Where&#8217;d you come by them di&#8217;monds and pearls?
Where&#8217;d you come by them rubies an&#8217; watches? <i>You</i>&ndash;&ndash;Nick
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
Top: Twist Tickle hook-an&#8217;-line man! Buyin&#8217;
di&#8217;monds for a pauper,&#8221; he snorted, &#8220;an&#8217; drinkin&#8217;
Cheap an&#8217; Nasty! Them things don&#8217;t mix, Nick Top.
Go be hanged! The police &#8217;ll cotch ye yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; says my uncle, gently; &#8220;not yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom Bull stamped out in a rage.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; my uncle repeated, wiping the sweat from
his brow, &#8220;Tom Bull forgotten; the police &#8217;ll not cotch
me. Oh no, Dannie!&#8221; he sighed. &#8220;They&#8217;ll not cotch
me&ndash;&ndash;not yet!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Then out of the black night came late company like
a squall o&#8217; wind: Cap&#8217;n Jack Large, no less! newly in
from Cadiz, in salt, with a spanking passage to make
water-side folk stare at him (the <i>Last Hope</i> was the
scandal of her owners). He turned the tap-room into
an uproar; and no man would believe his tale. &#8217;Twas
beyond belief, with Longway&#8217;s trim, new, two-hundred-ton
<i>Flying Fish</i>, of the same sailing, not yet
reported! And sighting Nicholas Top and me, Cap&#8217;n
Jack Large cast off the cronies he had gathered in the
tap-room progress of the night, and came to our stall,
as I expected when he bore in from the rain, and
sent my uncle&#8217;s bottle of Cheap and Nasty off with
contempt, and called for a bottle of Long Tom (the
best, as I knew, the Anchor and Chain afforded),
which must be broached under his eye, and said he
would drink with us until we were turned out or dawn
came. Lord, how I loved that man, as a child, in
those days: his jollity and bigness and courage and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
sea-clear eyes! &#8217;Twas grand to feel, aside from the
comfort of him, that he had put grown folk away to
fondle the child on his knee&ndash;&ndash;a mystery, to be sure,
but yet a grateful thing. Indeed, &#8217;twas marvellously
comfortable to sit close to him. But I never saw him
again: for the <i>Last Hope</i> went down, with a cargo of
mean fish, in the fall of the next year, in the sea between
St. John&#8217;s and the West Indies.</p>
<p>But that night&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cap&#8217;n Jack,&#8221; says I, &#8220;you quit that basket.&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You quit her,&#8221; I pleaded. &#8220;But ecod, man!&#8221;
says I, &#8220;please quit her. An you don&#8217;t I&#8217;ll never see
you more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; you&#8217;ll never care,&#8221; cries he. &#8220;Not <i>you</i>, Master
Callaway!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you quit her, man!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I isn&#8217;t able,&#8221; says he, drawing me to his knee;
&#8220;for, Dannie,&#8221; says he, his blue eyes alight, &#8220;they
isn&#8217;t ar another man in Newf&#8217;un&#8217;land would take that
basket t&#8217; sea!&#8221;</p>
<p>I sighed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, Dannie,&#8221; says he, &#8220;what&#8217;ll ye take t&#8217;
drink?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A nip o&#8217; ginger-ale,&#8221; says I, dolefully.</p>
<p>Cap&#8217;n Jack put his arm around the bar-maid.
&#8220;Fetch Dannie,&#8221; says he, &#8220;the brand that comes
from over-seas.&#8221;</p>
<p>Off she went.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord love us!&#8221; groans my uncle; &#8220;that&#8217;s two.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span></div>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twill do un no harm, Nick,&#8221; says Cap&#8217;n Jack.
&#8220;You just dose un well when you gets un back t&#8217; the
Tickle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; says my uncle.</p>
<p>He did....</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>And we made a jovial night of it. Cap&#8217;n Jack
would not let me off his knee. Not he! He held me
close and kindly; and while he yarned of the passage
to my uncle, and interjected strange wishes for a wife,
he whispered many things in my ear to delight me,
and promised me, upon his word, a sailing from St.
John&#8217;s to Spanish ports, when I was grown old enough,
if only I would come in that basket of a <i>Lost Hope</i>,
which I maintained I never would do. &#8217;Twas what
my uncle was used to calling a lovely time; and, as
for me, I wish I were a child again, and Cap&#8217;n Jack
were come in from the rain, and my uncle tipping
the bottle of Long Tom (though &#8217;twere a scandal).
Ay, indeed I do! That I were a child again, used to
tap-room bottles, and that big Cap&#8217;n Jack had come
in from the gale to tell me I was a brave lad in whom
he found a comfort neither of the solid land nor of
water-side companionship. But I did not think of
Cap&#8217;n Jack that night, when my uncle had stowed me
away in my bed at the hotel; but, rather, in the long,
wakeful hours, through which I lay alone, I thought
of Tom Bull&#8217;s question, &#8220;Where&#8217;d ye get them
jools?&#8221;</p>
<p>I had never before been troubled&ndash;&ndash;not once;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
always I had worn the glittering stones without question.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;d ye get them jools?&#8221;</p>
<p>I could not fall asleep: I repeated the twenty-third
psalm, according to my teaching; but still I could not
fall asleep....</p>

<h2>III</h2>
<h3>THE CATECHISM AT TWIST TICKLE</h3>
</div>
<p>Of an evening at Twist Tickle Nicholas Top would
sit unstrung and wistful in his great chair by the
west window, with the curtains drawn wide, there
waiting, in deepening gloom and fear, for the last light
to leave the world. With his head fallen upon his
breast and his eyes grown fixed and tragical with far-off
gazing, he would look out upon the appalling sweep
of sea and rock and sky, where the sombre wonder of
the dusk was working more terribly than with thunder:
clouds in embers, cliffs and mist and tumbling water
turning to shadows, vanishing, as though they were
not. In the place of a shining world, spread familiar
and open, from its paths to the golden haze of its
uttermost parts, there would come the cloud and
mystery and straying noises of the night, wherein lurk
and peer and restlessly move whatsoever may see in the
dark.</p>
<p>Thus would he sit oppressed while night covered the
world he knew by day. And there would come up
from the sea its voice; and the sea has no voice, but
mysteriously touches the strings within the soul of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
a man, so that the soul speaks in its own way, each
soul lifting its peculiar message. For me &#8217;twas sweet
to watch the tender shadows creep upon the western
fire, to see the great gray rocks dissolve, to hear
the sea&#8217;s melodious whispering; but to him (it seemed)
the sea spoke harshly and the night came with
foreboding. In the silence and failing light of the
hour, looking upon the stupendous works of the Lord,
he would repeat the words of the prophet of the Lord:</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>For behold the Lord will come with fire, and with his
chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury,
and his rebuke with the flames of fire.</i>&#8221; And again, with
his hand upon his forehead and his brows fallen hopelessly,
&#8220;<i>With his chariots like a whirlwind, to render
his anger with fury, and his rebuke with the flames of
fire.</i>&#8221; Still repeating the awful words, his voice broken
to a terrified whisper, &#8220;<i>His rebuke with the flames of
fire!</i>&#8221; And in particular moods, when the prophets,
however sonorous, were inadequate to his need, my
uncle would have recourse to his own pithy vocabulary
for terms with which to anathematize himself; but
these, of course, may not be written in a book.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>When the dusk was come my uncle would turn
blithely from this melancholy contemplation and call
for a lamp and his bottle. While I was about this
business (our maid-servant would not handle the bottle
lest she be damned for it), my uncle would stump the
floor, making gallant efforts to whistle and trill: by
this exhorting himself to a cheerful mood, so that when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
I had moved his great chair to the table, with the lamp
near and turned high, and had placed a stool for his
wooden leg, and had set his bottle and glass and little
brown jug of cold water conveniently at hand, his face
would be pleasantly rippling and his eyes all a-twinkle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Up with un, Dannie!&#8221; says he.</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas his fancy that he had gout in the tip of his
wooden leg. I must lift the ailing bit of timber to the
stool with caution.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ouch!&#8221; groans he. &#8220;Easy, lad!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas now in place.</p>
<p>&#8220;All ship-shape an&#8217; cheerful,&#8221; says he. &#8220;Pass the
bottle.&#8221;</p>
<p>He would then stand me up for catechism; and to
this task I would come with alacrity, and my heels
would come together, and my shoulders square, and
my hands go behind my back, as in the line at school.
&#8217;Twas a solemn game, whatever the form it took,
whether dealing with my possessions, hopes, deportment,
or what-not; and however grotesque an appearance
the thing may wear, &#8217;twas done in earnest by us
both and with some real pains (when I was stupid or
sleepy) to me. &#8217;Twas the way he had, too, of teaching
me that which he would have me conceive him to be&ndash;&ndash;of
fashioning in my heart and mind the character he
would there wear. A clumsy, forecastle method, and
most pathetically engaging, to be sure! but in effect
unapproached: for to this day, when I know him as
he was, the man he would appear to be sticks in my
heart and will not be supplanted. Nor would I willingly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
yield the wistful old dog&#8217;s place to a gentleman
of more brilliant parts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dannie, lad,&#8221; he would begin, in the manner of a
visiting trustee, but yet with a little twitch and flush
of embarrassment, which must be wiped away with
his great bandanna handkerchief&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;Dannie, lad,&#8221; he
would begin, &#8220;is ol&#8217; Nicholas Top a well-knowed figger
in Newf&#8217;un&#8217;land?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s knowed,&#8221; was the response I had been taught,
&#8220;from Cape Race t&#8217; Chidley.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Standin&#8217; by.&#8221;</p>
<p>So far so good; my uncle would beam upon me, as
though the compliment were of my own devising, until
&#8217;twas necessary once more to wipe the smile and blush
from his great wet countenance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it righteous,&#8221; says he, &#8220;t&#8217; stand by?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis that.&#8221;</p>
<p>He would now lean close with his poser: &#8220;Does it
say so in the Bible? Ah ha, lad! Does it say so
<i>there</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twas left out,&#8221; says I, having to this been scandalously
taught, &#8220;by mistake!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas my uncle&#8217;s sad habit thus to solve his ethical
difficulties. To a gigantic, thumb-worn Bible he would
turn, the which, having sought with unsuccess until
his temper was hot, he would fling back to its place,
growling: &#8220;Them ol&#8217; prophets was dunderheads, anyhow;
they left out more&#8217;n they put in. Why, Dannie,&#8221;
in vast disgust, &#8220;you don&#8217;t find the mention of barratry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
from jib-boom t&#8217; taffrail! An&#8217; you mean t&#8217; set there
an&#8217; tell me them prophets didn&#8217;t make no mistake?
No, sir! I &#8217;low they was well rope&#8217;s-ended for neglect
o&#8217; dooty when the Skipper cotched un in the other
Harbor.&#8221; But if by chance, in his impatient haste,
he stumbled upon some confirmation of his own philosophy,
he would crow: &#8220;There you got it, Dannie!
Right under the thumb o&#8217; me! Them ol&#8217; bullies was
wise as owls.&#8221; &#8217;Twas largely a matter of words, no
doubt (my uncle being self-taught in all things);
and &#8217;tis possible that the virtue of standing by, indirectly
commended, to be sure, is not specifically
and in terms enjoined upon the righteous. However&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, now!&#8221; says my uncle; &#8220;would you say that
ol&#8217; Nicholas Top was <i>famous</i> for standin&#8217; by?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas hard to remember the long response. &#8220;Well,&#8221;
I must begin, in a doubtful drawl, every word and
changing inflection his own, as I had been taught,
&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t go <i>quite</i> t&#8217; the length o&#8217; that. Ol&#8217; Nicholas
Top wouldn&#8217;t claim it hisself. Ol&#8217; Nicholas Top on&#8217;y
claims that he&#8217;s <i>good</i> at standin&#8217; by. His cronies do
&#8217;low that he can&#8217;t be beat at it by ar a man in Newf&#8217;un&#8217;land;
but Nicholas wouldn&#8217;t go t&#8217; the length o&#8217; <i>sayin&#8217;</i>
so hisself. &#8216;Ol&#8217; Nick,&#8217; says they, &#8216;would stand by if
the ship was skippered by the devil and inbound on
a fiery wind t&#8217; the tickle t&#8217; hell. Whatever Nick says
he&#8217;ll <i>do</i>,&#8217; says they, &#8216;is all the same as <i>did</i>; an&#8217; if he
says he&#8217;ll stand by, he&#8217;ll stick, blow high or blow low,
fog, ice, or reefs. &#8220;Be jiggered t&#8217; port an&#8217; weather!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
says he.&#8217;<a name='FNanchor_0001' id='FNanchor_0001'></a><a href='#Footnote_0001' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a> But sure,&#8221; I must conclude, &#8220;ol&#8217; Nicholas
wouldn&#8217;t say so hisself. An&#8217; so I wouldn&#8217;t go t&#8217; the
length o&#8217; holdin&#8217; that he was famous for standin&#8217; by.
Take it by an&#8217; all, if I was wantin&#8217; sea room, I&#8217;d stick
t&#8217; <i>well knowed</i> an&#8217; be done with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Co&#8217;-rect!&#8221; says my uncle, with a smack of satisfaction.
&#8220;You got that long one right, Dannie. An&#8217;
now, lad,&#8221; says he, his voice turning soft and genuine
in feeling, &#8220;what&#8217;s the ol&#8217; sailorman tryin&#8217; t&#8217; make out
o&#8217; <i>you</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A gentleman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; why?&#8221;</p>
<p>Then this disquieting response:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis none o&#8217; my business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twould have been logical had he asked me: &#8220;An&#8217;,
Dannie, lad, what&#8217;s a gentleman?&#8221; But this he never
did; and I think, regarding the thing from this distance,
that he was himself unable to frame the definition,
so that, of course, I never could be taught it. But
he was diligent in pursuit of this knowledge; he sat
with open ears in those exclusive tap-rooms where
&#8220;the big bugs t&#8217; St. John&#8217;s&#8221; (as he called them)
congregated; indeed, the little gold watch by which
Skipper Tom Bull&#8217;s suspicion had been excited at the
Anchor and Chain came to me immediately after the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
Commissioner of This had remarked to the Commissioner
of That, within my uncle&#8217;s hearing&ndash;&ndash;this at the
Gold Bullet over a bottle of Long Tom&ndash;&ndash;that a watch
of modest proportions was the watch for a gentleman
to wear (my other watches had been chosen with an
opposite idea). And my uncle, too (of which anon),
held in high regard that somewhat questionable light
of morality and deportment whom he was used to
calling ol&#8217; Skipper Chesterfield. But &#8220;What is a gentleman?&#8221;
was omitted from my catechism.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; is this ol&#8217; Nicholas Top a liar?&#8221; says my uncle.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he a thief?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Smuggler?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have he ever been mixed up in burglary, murder,
arson, barratry, piracy, fish stealin&#8217;, or speckalation?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>To indicate his utter detachment from personal
interest in the question to follow, my uncle would
wave his dilapidated hand, as though leaving me free
to answer as I would, which by no means was I.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; of how much,&#8221; says he, &#8220;would he rob his
neighbor that he might prosper?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas now time for me to turn loud and indignant,
as I had been taught. Thus: my head must shoot out
in truculent fashion, my brows bend, my lips curl away
from my teeth like a snarling dog&#8217;s, my eyes glare;
and I must let my small body shake with explosive
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
rage, in imitation of my uncle, while I brought the
table a thwack with all my force, shouting:</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a damn copper!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; says my uncle, placidly. &#8220;You done that
very well, Dannie, for a lad. You fetched out the
damn quite noisy an&#8217; agreeable. Now,&#8221; says he, &#8220;is
Nicholas Top a rascal?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas here we had trouble; in the beginning, when
this learning was undertaken, I must be whipped to
answer as he would have me. Ay, and many a night
have I gone sore to bed for my perversity, for in respect
to obedience his severity was unmitigated, as
with all seafaring men. But I might stand obstinate
for a moment&ndash;&ndash;a moment of grace. And upon the
wall behind his chair, hanging in the dimmer light,
was a colored print portraying a blue sea, spread with
rank upon rank of accurately measured waves, each
with its tiny cap of foam, stretching without diminution
to the horizon, upon which was perched a full-rigged
ship, a geometrical triumph; and from this vessel came
by small-boat to the strand a company of accurately
moulded, accurately featured, accurately tailored fellows,
pulling with perfect accuracy in every respect.
I shall never forget the geometrical gentleman upon
that geometrically tempestuous sea, for as I stood sullen
before my uncle they provided the only distraction
at hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, Daniel!&#8221; says he, in a little flare of wrath;
&#8220;is he a rascal?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; says I, defiantly, &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard un lied about.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Wrong!&#8221; roars my uncle. &#8220;Try again, sir! Is ol&#8217;
Nicholas Top a rascal?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no help for it. I must say the unkind
words or be thrashed for an obstinate whelp.</p>
<p>&#8220;A damned rascal, sir!&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Co&#8217;-<i>rect</i>!&#8221; cries my uncle, delighted.<a name='FNanchor_0002' id='FNanchor_0002'></a><a href='#Footnote_0002' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a></p>
<p>And now, presently, my uncle would drawl, &#8220;Well,
Dannie, lad, you might &#8217;s well measure out the other,&#8221;
and when I had with care poured his last dram would
send me off to bed. Sometimes he would have me say
my prayers at his knee&ndash;&ndash;not often&ndash;&ndash;most when high
winds, without rain, shook our windows and sang
mournfully past the cottage, and he was unnerved by
the night. &#8220;The wind&#8217;s high the night,&#8221; says he, with
an anxious frown; &#8220;an&#8217; Dannie,&#8221; says he, laying a
hand upon my head, &#8220;you might &#8217;s well overhaul that
there</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&#8220;&#8216;<i>Jesus, tender Shepherd, hear me,<br />

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span></div>
<p>afore you turns in. &#8217;Twill do you good, an&#8217; &#8217;twon&#8217;t
manage t&#8217; do me no harm.&#8221; And this done I would
off to bed; but had no sooner bade him good-night,
got my gruff response, and come to the foot of the
stair, than, turning to say good-night again, I would
find myself forgot. My uncle would be sunk dejectedly
in his great chair, his scarred face drawn and
woful. I see him now&ndash;&ndash;under the lamp&ndash;&ndash;a gray,
monstrous, despairing man, a bottle beside him, the
familiar things of the place in shadow. The old feeling
of wonder and regret returns. I sigh&ndash;&ndash;as then, a
child, bound up to a lonely chamber in the night, I
sighed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night, sir!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no response; but he would look in upon
me on the way to bed&ndash;&ndash;into the little room where
I lay luxuriously, in the midst of those extravagant
comforts which so strangely came to me. And more
often than not he would haul this way and that upon
the covers until, as though by some unhappy accident,
I was awakened.</p>
<p>&#8220;God bless you, Dannie,&#8221; says he.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas all he wanted&ndash;&ndash;a good wish spoken in the
night. To his own bare room he would then be off, a
bit uncertain (I recall) in the management of his
wooden leg.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Under my window, at the foot of a short cliff which
fell roughly into the open cove, as shall be told, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
sea broke. While sleep waited &#8217;twas my habit to listen
to the waves upon the rocks: in that brief and mystical
interval when many truths take shape, definite and
lovely, as in a mist, but are forgot before dawn stirs
us, nor can be remembered. Of still moonlit nights;
of windless dusks, with the swell of past storms sullenly
remaining; in clammy, breathless weather; with fresh
winds blowing our craft to and fro on their way in
search of the fish; in blackest gales, when the men of
Twist Tickle kept watch for wrecks upon the heads&ndash;&ndash;forever
I listened to the voice of the sea before I fell
asleep. But the sea has no voice, but may only play
upon the souls of men, which speak from the uttermost
depths, each soul in its own way: so that the sea
has a thousand voices, and listening men are tranquil
or not, as may chance within them, without mystery.
Never since those far-off days, when the sea took my
unspoiled soul as a harp in its hands, have I been
secure in the knowledge of truth, untroubled by bewilderment
and anxious questions. Untroubled by
love, by the fear of hell, &#8217;twas good to be alive in a
world where the sea spoke tenderly below the window
of the room where sleep came bearing dreams.</p>
<p>And my uncle? God knows! The harp was warped,
and the strings of the harp were broken and out of
tune....</p>
<div class='footnote'><a name='Footnote_0001' id='Footnote_0001'></a><a href='#FNanchor_0001'><span class='label'>[1]</span></a>
<p>&#8217;Twas really &#8220;damned t&#8217; port an&#8217; weather&#8221; my uncle
would have me say; but I hesitate to set it down, lest the
more gentle readers of my simple narrative think ill of
the man&#8217;s dealings with a child, which I would not have
them do.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote'><a name='Footnote_0002' id='Footnote_0002'></a><a href='#FNanchor_0002'><span class='label'>[2]</span></a>
<p>Of course, the frequent recurrence of this vulgarity in
my narrative is to be regretted. No one, indeed, is more
sensible of the circumstance than I. My uncle held the
word in affectionate regard, and usefully employed it:
&#8217;tis the only apology I have to offer. Would it not be
possible for the more delicate readers of my otherwise inoffensive
narrative to elide the word? or to supply, on the
spur of the moment, an acceptable equivalent, of which,
I am told, there is an infinite variety? or (better still) to
utter it courageously? I am for the bolder course: &#8217;tis a
discipline rich in cultural advantages. But &#8217;tis for the
reader, of course, to choose the alternative.</p>

<h2>IV</h2>
<h3>ON SINISTER BUSINESS</h3>
</div>
<p>Our pilgrimages to St. John&#8217;s, occurring twice a
year, were of a singular description: not only in the
manner of our progress, which was unexampled, in view
of our relationship and condition, but in the impenetrable
character of our mission and in the air of low rascality
it unfailingly wore. For many days before our departure
from Twist Tickle by the outside boat, my uncle
would quit the Green Bull grounds, where he fished
with hook and line, would moor his punt fore and aft,
and take to the bleak hills of Twin Islands, there (it
seemed) to nurse some questionable design: whence
at dusk he would emerge, exhausted in leg and spirit,
but yet with strength to mutter obscure imprecations
as he came tapping up the gravelled walk from the
gate, and with the will to manage a bottle and glass in
the kitchen.</p>
<p>&#8220;The bottle!&#8221; cries he. &#8220;Ecod! the dog&#8217;ll never
scare ol&#8217; Nick Top. Dannie, the bottle!&#8221;</p>
<p>While I fled for this he would sit growling by the
table; but before I was well returned the humor would
be vanishing, so that sometimes I guessed (but might
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
be mistaken) he practised this rage and profanity to
play a part.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ol&#8217; Nick Top,&#8221; says he, &#8220;is as saucy a dog as
you&#8217;ll find in the pack!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas said with a snap.</p>
<p>&#8220;A saucy ol&#8217; dog!&#8221; snarls he. &#8220;An&#8217; Lord love ye!
but he&#8217;s able t&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;t&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;t&#8217; <i>bite</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Nick,&#8221; says I, &#8220;you&#8217;re all wore out along o&#8217;
walkin&#8217; them hills.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wore out!&#8221; cries he, an angry flash in his wide
little eyes. &#8220;<i>Me</i> wore out?... Pass the bottle....
Ye&#8217;d never think it, lad, an ye could see me t&#8217; St.
John&#8217;s,&#8221; says he, &#8220;at the&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The revelation came to a full stop with the tipping of
the square black bottle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s that?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis a wee water-side place, lad,&#8221; says he, with
a grave wink, &#8220;where ol&#8217; Nick Top&#8217;s the sauciest dog
in the pack!&#8221;</p>
<p>I would pass the water for his liquor.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; here,&#8221; cries he, toasting with solemn enthusiasm,
&#8220;is wishin&#8217; all water-side rascals in&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;&#8217;twas now a long
pull at the glass&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;jail!&#8221; says he. &#8220;&#8217;Twould go agin
my conscience t&#8217; wish un worse. I really isn&#8217;t able!&#8221;</p>
<p>By these wanderings on the hills the slow, suspicious
wits of our folk of Twist Tickle were mystified and
aroused to superstitious imaginings. &#8217;Twas inevitable
that they should pry and surmise&ndash;&ndash;surmising much
more than they dared pry. They were never bold,
however, in the presence of my uncle, whether because
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
of their courteous ways or because of his quick temper
and sulphurous tongue, in respect to meddling, I am
not able to say; but no doubt they would have troubled
us a deal had my uncle even so much as admitted by
the set of his eyelid (which he never would do) that
there was a mystery concerning us. The lads of the
place lurked upon the hills when the business went
forward, continuing in desperate terror of my uncle at
such times. They learned, notwithstanding their fright,
that he trudged far and hard, at first smiling with the
day, then muttering darkly, at last wrathfully swishing
the spruce with his staff; but not one of them could
follow to the discovery of the secret, whatever it might
be, so that, though &#8217;twas known the old man exchanged
a genial humor for an execrable one, the why
and wherefore were never honestly fathomed.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Came, at last, the day before our departure, upon
which my wardrobe for the journey must be chosen
from the closets and chests, inspected, scrupulously
packed&ndash;&ndash;this for travel, that for afternoon, this, again,
for dinner&ndash;&ndash;tweed and serge and velvet: raiment for
all occasions, for all weathers, as though, indeed, I
were to spend time with the governor of the colony.
Trinkets and cravats presented pretty questions for
argument, in which my uncle delighted, and would
sustain with spirit, watching rather wistfully, I recall,
to see my interest wax; and my interest would sometimes
wax too suddenly for belief, inspired by his
melancholy disappointment, so that he would dig me
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
in the ribs with his long forefinger and laugh at me
because he had discovered my deception. My uncle
was a nice observer (and diligent) of fashion, and a
stickler for congruity of dress, save in the matter of
rings and the like, with which, perhaps, he was in the
way of too largely adorning me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye&#8217;ll be wearin&#8217; the new Turkish outfit aboard
ship, Dannie?&#8221; says he.</p>
<p>I would not.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lon&#8217;on <i>Haberdasher</i> come out strong,&#8221; says he, at
a coax, &#8220;on Turkish outfits for seven-year-olds.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas not persuasive.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wonderful pop&#8217;lar across the water.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; I would protest, &#8220;I&#8217;m not likin&#8217; the queer
red cap.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Dannie,&#8221; says he, &#8220;I fears ye&#8217;ll never be much
of a gentleman if ye&#8217;re careless o&#8217; the fashion. Not in
the fashion, out o&#8217; the world! What have ol&#8217; Skipper
Chesterfield t&#8217; say on that p&#8217;int? Eh, lad? What
have the bully ol&#8217; skipper t&#8217; say&ndash;&ndash;underlined by Sir
Harry? A list o&#8217; the ornamental accomplishments,
volume II., page 24. &#8216;T&#8217; be extremely clean in your
person,&#8217; says he, &#8216;an&#8217; perfeckly well dressed, accordin&#8217;
t&#8217; the fashion, be that what it will.&#8217; There you haves
it, lad, underlined by Sir Harry! <i>&#8216;Be that what
it will.&#8217;</i> But ye&#8217;re not likin&#8217; the queer red cap, eh?
Ah, well! I &#8217;low, then, ye&#8217;ll be havin&#8217; t&#8217; don the
kilt.&#8221;</p>
<p>This I would hear with relief.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I &#8217;low,&#8221; growls he, &#8220;that Sir Harry an&#8217; Skipper
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
Chesterfield haves the right of it: for they&#8217;re both
strong on manners&ndash;&ndash;if weak on morals.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aboard ship I was put in the cabin and commanded
to bear myself like a gentleman: whereupon I was
abandoned, my uncle retreating in haste and purple
confusion from the plush and polish and glitter of the
state-room. But he would never fail to turn at the
door (or come stumping back through the passage);
and now heavily oppressed by my helplessness and
miserable loneliness and the regrettable circumstances
of my life&ndash;&ndash;feeling, it may be, some fear for me and
doubt of his own wisdom&ndash;&ndash;he would regard me anxiously.
To this day he lingers thus in my memory:
leaning forward upon his short staff, half within the
bright light, half lost in shadow, upon his poor, fantastic,
strangely gentle countenance an expression of
tenderest solicitude, which still would break, against
his will, in ripples of the liveliest admiration at my
appearance and luxurious situation, but would quickly
recover its quality of concern and sympathy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dannie, lad,&#8221; he would prescribe, &#8220;you better overhaul
the twenty-third psa&#8217;m afore turnin&#8217; in.&#8221;</p>
<p>To this I would promise.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;The Lard is my shepherd,&#8217;&#8221; says he. &#8220;&#8216;I shall
not want.&#8217; Say it twice,&#8221; says he, as if two doses were
more salutary than one, &#8220;an&#8217; you&#8217;ll feel better in the
mornin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>To this a doleful assent.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; ye&#8217;ll make good use o&#8217; your time with the
gentlefolk, Dannie?&#8221; says he. &#8220;Keep watch on &#8217;em,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
lad, an&#8217; ye&#8217;ll l&#8217;arn a wonderful lot about manners.
&#8216;List o&#8217; the necessary ornamental accomplishments
(without which no man livin&#8217; can either please or rise
in the world), which hitherto I fear ye want,&#8217;&#8221; quotes
he, most glibly, &#8220;&#8216;an&#8217; which only require your care an&#8217;
attention t&#8217; possess.&#8217; Volume II., page 24. &#8216;A distinguished
politeness o&#8217; manners an&#8217; address, which
common-sense, observation, good company, an&#8217; imitation
will give ye if ye will accept it.&#8217; There you haves
it, Dannie&ndash;&ndash;underlined by Sir Harry! Ye got the
sense, ye got the eye, an&#8217; here&#8217;s the company. Lord love
ye, Dannie, the Commissioner o&#8217; Lands is aboard with
his lady! No less! An&#8217; I&#8217;ve heared tell of a Yankee
millionaire cruisin&#8217; these parts. They&#8217;ll be wonderful
handy for practice. Lay alongside, Dannie&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217;
imitate the distinguished politeness: for ol&#8217; Skipper
Chesterfield cracks up imitation an&#8217; practice most
wonderful high!&#8221;</p>
<p>The jangle of the bell in the engine-room would now
interrupt him. The mail was aboard: the ship bound
out.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; Dannie,&#8221; says my uncle, feeling in haste for
the great handkerchief (to blow his nose, you may be
sure), &#8220;I&#8217;m not able t&#8217; <i>think</i> o&#8217; you bein&#8217; lonely. I&#8217;m
for&#8217;ard in the steerage, lad&ndash;&ndash;just call that t&#8217; mind.
An&#8217; if ye find no cure in that, why, lad&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;in a squall
of affectionate feeling, his regard for gentility quite
vanished&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;sink me an&#8217; that damn ol&#8217; Chesterfield
overside, an&#8217; overhaul the twenty-third psa&#8217;m!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, sir.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You is safe enough, lad; for, Dannie&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas in the imperative tone, and I must instantly
and sharply attend.</p>
<p>&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;I&#8217;m for&#8217;ard, standin&#8217; by!&#8221;</p>
<p>He would then take himself off to the steerage for
good; and &#8217;twas desperately lonely for me, aboard the
big ship, tossing by night and day through the rough
waters of our coast.</p>

<h3>TAP-TAP ON THE PAVEMENT</h3>
</div>
<p>My uncle would not have speech with me again,
lest his rough look and ways endanger the social
advantages he conceived me to enjoy in the cabin, but
from the lower deck would keep sly watch upon me,
and, unobserved of others, would with the red bandanna
handkerchief flash me messages of affection and
encouragement, to which I must not for the life of me
respond. Soon, however, &#8217;twas my turn to peer and
wish; for, perceiving at last that I was not ill (the
weather being fair), and that I had engaged the companionship
of gentlefolk&ndash;&ndash;they were quick enough,
indeed, these St. John&#8217;s folk and spying wanderers, to
attach themselves to the mystery of old Nick Top&#8217;s
child&ndash;&ndash;my uncle would devote himself to his own concerns
with unhappy result.</p>
<p>The manner of his days of preparation upon the
hills of Twin Islands would return: the ill temper and
cunning and evil secretiveness, joined now with the
hang-dog air he habitually wore in the city. And these
distressful appearances would by day and night increase,
as we passed the Funks, came to Bonavist&#8217; Bay, left
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
the Bacalieu light behind and rounded the Brandy
Rocks, until, instead of a rotund, twinkling old sea-dog,
with a gargoylish countenance, with which the
spirit had nothing to do, there landed on the wharf at
the city a swaggering, wrathy pirate, of devilish cast
and temper, quick to flush and bluster, mighty in
profanity, far gone in drink.</p>
<p>Thence to the hotel, in this wise: my uncle, being
clever with his staff and wooden leg and vastly strong,
would shoulder my box, make way through the gang-plank
idlers and porters with great words, put me
grandly in the lead, come gasping at a respectful distance
behind, modelling his behavior (as he thought)
after that of some flunky of nobility he had once
clapped eyes on; and as we thus proceeded up the
hill&ndash;&ndash;a dandy in tartan kilt and velvet and a gray ape
in slops&ndash;&ndash;he would have a quick word of wrath for
any passenger that might chance to jostle me. &#8217;Twas
a conspicuous progress, craftily designed, as, long afterwards,
I learned; we were not long landed, you may be
sure, before the town was aware that the mystery of
Twist Tickle was once more come in by the <i>Lake</i>: old
Skipper Nicholas Top and the lad with the rings, as
they called me!</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Having come now to the hotel (this by night), where
would be a cheerful fire awaiting us in my comfortable
quarters, my uncle would unstrap my box and dispose
its contents in clean and handy places, urging me the
while, like a mother, to make good use of my opportunity
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
to observe the ways of gentlefolk, especially as
practised in the dining-room of the hotel, that I might
expeditiously master polite manners, which was a thing
Skipper Chesterfield held most seriously in high opinion.
I must thus conduct myself (he said), rather than idly
brood, wishing for his company: for a silk purse was
never yet made of a sow&#8217;s ear but with pain to all
concerned. &#8220;An&#8217; Dannie,&#8221; says he, jovially, when he
had clapped the last drawer shut and put my nightclothes
to warm at the fire, &#8220;if you was t&#8217; tweak that
there bell-pull&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>I would gladly tweak it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank &#8217;e, Dannie,&#8221; says my uncle, gently. &#8220;It&#8217;ll
be the best Jamaica&ndash;&ndash;a nip afore I goes.&#8221;</p>
<p>In response to this would come old Elihu Wall,
whom in private I loved, exaggerating every obsequious
trick known to his kind to humor my uncle. I
must then act my part, as I had been taught, thus:
must stride to the fire, turn, spread my legs, scowl,
meditatively ply a tooth-pick (alas! my groping uncle),
become aware of old Elihu Wall, become haughtily
conscious of my uncle, now in respectful attitude upon
his foot and wooden leg; and I must scowl again, in a
heavier way, as though angered by this interruption,
and rub my small quarters, now heated near beyond
endurance, and stare at the ceiling, and, dropping my
eyes sharply upon Elihu Wall, say with a haughty
sniff, a haughty curl of the lip:</p>
<p>&#8220;Elihu&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;with a superior jerk towards my uncle&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;fetch
this man a dram o&#8217; your best Jamaica!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span></div>
<p>&#8217;Twas not hard to do&ndash;&ndash;not hard to learn: for my
uncle was unceasing in solicitous and patient instruction,
diligent in observation, as he cruised in those
exclusive places to which (somehow) he gained admittance
for my sake and a jolly welcome for his own.
And &#8217;twas a grateful task, too, to which I heartily
gave my interest, for I loved my uncle. &#8217;Twas his way
of teaching me not only the gentlemanly art of dealing
with menials, as he had observed it, but, on his part, as
he stood stiff and grave, the proper attitude of a servant
towards his master. In these days, long distant from
the first strange years of my life, I am glad that I was
not wilful with him&ndash;&ndash;glad that I did not obstinately
resist the folly and boredom of the thing, as I was inclined
to do. But, indeed, it must not be counted
to me for virtue; for my uncle had a ready hand, though
three fingers were missing, and to this day I remember
the odd red mark it left (the thumb, forefinger, and
palm), when, upon occasion, it fell upon me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Elihu,&#8221; says I, &#8220;fetch this man a dram o&#8217; your
best Jamaica!&#8221;</p>
<p>Upon the disappearance of Elihu Wall, my uncle and
I would resume intimate relations.</p>
<p>&#8220;You done well, Dannie!&#8221; cries he, gleefully rubbing
his hands. &#8220;I never knowed Sir Harry t&#8217; do it
better.&#8221;</p>
<p>We were both mightily proud.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dannie,&#8221; says he, presently, with gleeful interest,
&#8220;give un a good one when he gets back. Like a gentleman,
Dannie. Just t&#8217; show un what you can do.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span></div>
<p>Enter Elihu Wall.</p>
<p>&#8220;What the devil d&#8217;ye mean?&#8221; says I, in wrath.
&#8220;Eh? What the devil d&#8217;ye mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; says Elihu Wall. &#8220;Sorry, sir. <i>Very</i>,
sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Devil take your sorrow!&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>I would then slip the old fellow a bit of silver, as I
was bidden, and he would obsequiously depart.<a name='FNanchor_0003' id='FNanchor_0003'></a><a href='#Footnote_0003' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a></p>
<p>&#8220;You done well, Dannie!&#8221; cries my uncle again, in
delight. &#8220;Lord! but &#8217;twas grand! You done wonderful
well! I never knowed Sir Harry t&#8217; do it better.
I wisht ol&#8217; Chesterfield was here t&#8217; see. Ecod!&#8221;
he chuckles, with a rub at his nose, gazing upon me
with affectionate admiration, in which was no small
dash of awe, &#8220;you done it well, my lad! I&#8217;ve heard
Sir Harry say <i>more</i>, mark you! but I&#8217;ve never knowed
un t&#8217; do it better. <i>More</i>, Dannie, but t&#8217; less purpose.
Ah, Dannie,&#8221; says he, fondly, &#8220;they&#8217;s the makin&#8217;s of
a gentleman in <i>you</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>I was pleased&ndash;&ndash;to be sure!</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; I &#8217;low, by an&#8217; all,&#8221; my uncle would boast,
scratching his head in high gratification, &#8220;that I&#8217;m
a-fetchin&#8217; ye up very well!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas hard on old Elihu Wall&ndash;&ndash;this unearned abuse.
But Elihu and I were fast friends, nevertheless: he
sped many a wearisome hour for me when my uncle
was upon his grim, mysterious business in the city;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
and I had long ago told him that he must not grieve,
whatever I said&ndash;&ndash;however caustic and unkind the
words&ndash;&ndash;because my uncle&#8217;s whims must be humored,
which was the end to be served by us both. With this
assurance of good feeling, old Elihu Wall was content.
He took my insolence in good part, playing the game
cheerfully: knowing that the hard words were uttered
without intention to wound, but only in imitation of
gentlemen, from whom Elihu Wall suffered enough,
Heaven knows! (as he confided to me) not to mind what
I might say.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>I must tell that, once, taken with pain, having overeaten
myself, left alone in the hotel at St. John&#8217;s, I
got out of bed and sought my uncle&#8217;s lodgings, which
I was never permitted to see. &#8217;Twas a rough search
for a sick child to follow through in the night, ending
by the water-side&ndash;&ndash;a dismal stair, leading brokenly
to a wretched room, situate over a tap-room too
low for frequency by us, where women quarrelled
with men. Here my uncle sat with his bottle, not
yet turned in. He was amazed when I entered, but
scolded me not at all; and he gave me brandy to
drink, until my head swam, and took me to sleep
with him, for the only time in all my life. When
I awoke &#8217;twas to disgust with the bed and room in
which I lay&ndash;&ndash;with the smell and dirt of the place&ndash;&ndash;the
poverty and sordidness, to which I was not
used.</p>
<p>I complained of the housing my uncle had.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Dannie, lad,&#8221; says my uncle, sighing unhappily,
&#8220;the old man&#8217;s poor, an&#8217; isn&#8217;t able t&#8217; help it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still I complained.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t, Dannie!&#8221; says he. &#8220;I isn&#8217;t able t&#8217; bear it.
An&#8217; I&#8217;m wishin&#8217; you&#8217;d never found out. The old
man&#8217;s poor&ndash;&ndash;wonderful poor. He&#8217;s on&#8217;y a hook-an&#8217;-line
man. For God&#8217;s sake ask un no questions!&#8221;</p>
<p>I asked him no questions....</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Every morning while at St. John&#8217;s, my uncle and I
must walk the lower streets: my hand in his, when I was
a child, and, presently, when I was grown into a lad,
myself at his heels. Upon these occasions I must be
clad and conduct myself thus and so, with utmost
particularity: must be combed and brushed, and carry
my head bravely, and square my shoulders, and turn
out my toes, and cap my crown so that my unspeakably
wilful hair, which was never clipped short, as I
would have it, would appear in disarray. Never once
did I pass the anxious inspection without needing a
whisk behind, or, it may be, here and there, a touch
of my uncle&#8217;s thick finger, which seemed, somehow,
infinitely tender at that moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m wantin&#8217; ye, Dannie,&#8221; says he, &#8220;t&#8217; look like a
gentleman the day. They&#8217;ll be a thing come t&#8217; pass,
come a day.&#8221;</p>
<p>There invariably came a thing to pass&ndash;&ndash;a singular
thing, which I conceived to be the object of these
pilgrimages; being this: that when in the course of
our peregrinations we came to the crossing of King
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
Street with Water he would never fail to pause, tap-tap
a particular stone of the walk, and break into
muttered imprecations, continuing until folk stared
and heads were put out of the windows. In so far as
one might discern, there was nothing in that busy
neighborhood to excite the ill-temper of any man;
but at such times, as though courting the curious remark
he attracted, my uncle&#8217;s staff would strike the
pavement with an angry pat, his head wag and nod,
his eyes malevolently flash, and he would then so
hasten his steps that &#8217;twas no easy matter to keep pace
with him, until, once past, he would again turn placid
and slow.</p>
<p>&#8220;There you haves it, Dannie!&#8221; he would chuckle.
&#8220;There you haves it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas all a mystery.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>My uncle must once get very drunk at St. John&#8217;s&ndash;&ndash;this
for a day and a night, during which I must not
leave my quarters. These were times of terror&ndash;&ndash;and
of loneliness: for it seemed to my childish mind that
when my uncle was drunk I had no friend at all. But
&#8217;twas all plain sailing afterwards&ndash;&ndash;a sober, cheerful
guardian, restless to be off to Twist Tickle. My uncle
would buy new outfits for me at the shops, arrange the
regular shipment of such delicacies as the St. John&#8217;s
markets afforded according to the season, seek gifts
with which to delight and profit me, gather the news
of fashion, lie in wait for dropped hints as to the manners
and customs of gentlemen, procure his allowance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
of whiskey for the six months to come: in every way
providing for my happiness and well-being and for
such meagre comfort as he would allow himself.</p>
<p>Then off to Twist Tickle: and glad we were of it
when the <i>Lake</i> got beyond the narrows and the big,
clean, clear-aired sea lay ahead!</p>
<div class='footnote'><a name='Footnote_0003' id='Footnote_0003'></a><a href='#FNanchor_0003'><span class='label'>[3]</span></a>
<p>My uncle would instantly have thrashed me had I approached
an oath (or any other vulgarity) in conversation
upon ordinary occasions.</p>

<h2>VI</h2>
<h3>THE FEET OF CHILDREN</h3>
</div>
<p>Once of a still night at Twist Tickle (when I
was grown to be eleven) my uncle abandoned his
bottle and came betimes to my room to make sure
that I was snug in my sleep. &#8217;Twas fall weather without,
the first chill and frosty menace of winter abroad:
clear, windless, with all the stars that ever shone
a-twinkle in the far velvet depths of the sky beyond the
low window of my room. I had drawn wide the curtains
to let the companionable lights come in: to stare,
too, into the vast pool of shadows, which was the sea,
unquiet and sombre beneath the serenity and twinkling
splendor of the night. Thus I lay awake, high on the
pillows, tucked to my chin: but feigned a restful slumber
when I caught the sigh and downcast tread of his
coming.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dannie,&#8221; he whispered, &#8220;is you awake?&#8221;</p>
<p>I made no answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Dannie, isn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Still I would not heed him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wisht you was,&#8221; he sighed, &#8220;for I&#8217;m wonderful
lonely the night, lad, an&#8217; wantin&#8217; t&#8217; talk a spell.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></div>
<p>&#8217;Twas like a child&#8217;s beseeching. I was awake at
once&ndash;&ndash;wide awake for him: moved by the wistfulness
of this appeal to some perception of his need.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; is you comfortable, Dannie, lyin&#8217; there in your
own little bed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; happy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Grand, sir!&#8221; said I.</p>
<p>He crept softly to my bed. &#8220;You don&#8217;t mind?&#8221; he
whispered. I drew my feet away to make room. He
sat down, and for a moment patted me with the tenderness
of a woman. &#8220;You don&#8217;t mind?&#8221; he ventured
again, in diffidence. I did not mind (but would not
tell him so); nay, so far was I from any objection that
I glowed with content in this assurance of loving protection
from the ills of the world. &#8220;No?&#8221; said he.
&#8220;I&#8217;m glad o&#8217; that: for I&#8217;m so wonderful old an&#8217; lonely,
an&#8217; you&#8217;re sort o&#8217; all I got, Dannie, t&#8217; fondle. &#8217;Tis
pleasant t&#8217; touch a thing that&#8217;s young an&#8217; not yet
smirched by sin an&#8217; trouble. &#8217;Tis some sort o&#8217; cure
for the souls o&#8217; broken folk, I&#8217;m thinkin&#8217;. An&#8217; you
don&#8217;t mind? I&#8217;m glad o&#8217; that. You&#8217;re gettin&#8217; so wonderful
old yourself, Dannie, that I was a bit afeared.
A baby yesterday an&#8217; a man the morrow! You&#8217;re near
growed up. &#8217;Leven year old!&#8221; with a wry smile, in
which was no pride, but only poignant regret. &#8220;You&#8217;re
near growed up.&#8221; Presently he withdrew a little.
&#8220;Ay,&#8221; said he, gently; &#8220;you is housed an&#8217; clad an&#8217;
fed. So much I&#8217;ve managed well enough.&#8221; He paused&ndash;&ndash;distraught,
his brows bent, his hand passing aimlessly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
over the scars and gray stubble of his head.
&#8220;You&#8217;re happy, Dannie?&#8221; he asked, looking up.
&#8220;Come, now, is you sure? You&#8217;d not be makin&#8217; game
o&#8217; the old man, would you, Dannie? You&#8217;d not tell
un you <i>was</i> when you <i>wasn&#8217;t</i>, would you? Is you
sure you&#8217;re happy? An&#8217; you&#8217;re glad, is you, t&#8217; be
livin&#8217; all alone at Twist Tickle with a ol&#8217; feller like
Nick Top?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wonderful happy, sir,&#8221; I answered, used to the
question, free and prompt in response; &#8220;happy, sir&ndash;&ndash;with
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; you is sure?&#8221;</p>
<p>I was sure.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad o&#8217; that,&#8221; he continued, but with no relief
of the anxious gloom upon his face. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad you is
comfortable an&#8217; happy. I &#8217;low,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that poor
Tom Callaway would like t&#8217; get word of it. Poor Tom!
Poor ol&#8217; Tom! Lord love you, lad! he was your father:
an&#8217; he loved you well&ndash;&ndash;all too well. I &#8217;low he&#8217;d be
wonderful <i>glad</i> just t&#8217; know that you was comfortable
an&#8217; happy&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; good. You is good, isn&#8217;t you? Oh, I
knows you is! An&#8217; I wisht Tom Callaway could know.
I wisht he could: for I &#8217;low &#8217;twould perk un up a bit,
in the place he&#8217;s to, t&#8217; get wind of it that his little Dannie
was happy with ol&#8217; Nick Top. He&#8217;ve a good deal
t&#8217; bear, I&#8217;m thinkin&#8217;, where he&#8217;s to; an&#8217; &#8217;twould give
un something t&#8217; distract his mind if he knowed you
was doin&#8217; well. But, Dannie, lad,&#8221; he pursued, with a
lively little flash of interest, &#8220;they&#8217;s a queer thing about
that. Now, lad, mark you! &#8217;tis easy enough t&#8217; send
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
messages Aloft; but when it comes t&#8217; gettin&#8217; a line or
two o&#8217; comfort t&#8217; the poor damned folk Below, they&#8217;s
no mortal way that I ever heared tell on. Prayer,&#8221;
says he, &#8220;wings aloft, far beyond the stars, t&#8217; the ear o&#8217;
God Hisself; an&#8217; I wisht&ndash;&ndash;oh, I wisht&ndash;&ndash;they was the
same sort o&#8217; telegraph wire t&#8217; hell! For,&#8221; said he, sadly,
&#8220;I&#8217;ve got some news that I&#8217;d kind o&#8217; like t&#8217; send.&#8221;</p>
<p>I could not help him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m <i>tired</i>!&#8221; he complained, with a quick-drawn
sigh. &#8220;I&#8217;m all wore out; an&#8217; I wisht I could tell Tom
Callaway.&#8221;</p>
<p>I, too, sighed.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I &#8217;low,&#8221; was my uncle&#8217;s woe-begone conclusion,
&#8220;that that there poor ol&#8217; Tom Callaway &#8217;ll just have t&#8217;
wait till I sees un.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas with a start of horror that I surmised the
whereabouts of my father&#8217;s soul.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>We were but newly come from St. John&#8217;s: a long
sojourn in the water-side tap-rooms&ndash;&ndash;a dissipation protracted
beyond the habit (and will) of my uncle. I
had wearied, and had wondered, but had found no
explanation. There was a time when the rage and
stagger of his intoxicated day had been exceeded past
my remembrance and to my terror. I forgave him the
terror: I did, I am sure! there was no fright or humiliation
the maimed ape could put upon me but I
would freely forgive, remembering his unfailing affection.
&#8217;Twas all plain now: the course of his rascality
had not run smooth. I divined it; and I wished, I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
recall, lying there in the light of the untroubled stars,
that I might give of myself&ndash;&ndash;of the ease and placid outlook
he preserved for me&ndash;&ndash;some help to his distress and
melancholy. But I was a child: no more than a child&ndash;&ndash;unwise,
unhelpful, in a lad&#8217;s way vaguely feeling the
need of me from whom no service was due: having
intuitive discernment, but no grown tact and wisdom.
That he was scarred, two-fingered, wooden-legged, a
servant of the bottle, was apart: and why not? for I
was nourished by the ape that he was; and a child
loves (this at least) him who, elsewhere however repugnant,
fosters him. I could not help with any spoken
word, but still could have him think &#8217;twas grateful to
me to have him sit with me while I fell asleep; and
this I gladly did.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>My uncle looked up. &#8220;Dannie,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you
don&#8217;t mind me sittin&#8217; here for a spell on your little
bed, do you? Honest, now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas woful supplication: the voice a child&#8217;s voice;
the eyes&ndash;&ndash;dimly visible in the starlight&ndash;&ndash;a child&#8217;s beseeching
eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jus&#8217; for a little spell?&#8221; he pleaded.</p>
<p>I said that I was glad to have him.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; you isn&#8217;t so wonderful sleepy, is you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; I yawned.</p>
<p>He sighed. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad,&#8221; said he. &#8220;An&#8217; I&#8217;m grateful
t&#8217; you, lad, for bein&#8217; kind t&#8217; ol&#8217; Nick Top. He
ain&#8217;t worth it, Dannie&ndash;&ndash;<i>he&#8217;s</i> no good; he&#8217;s jus&#8217; a ol&#8217;
fool. But I&#8217;m lonely the night&ndash;&ndash;most wonderful lonely.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
I been thinkin&#8217; I was sort o&#8217; makin&#8217; a mess o&#8217;
things. You <i>is</i> happy, isn&#8217;t you, Dannie?&#8221; he asked,
in a flash of anxious mistrust. &#8220;An&#8217; comfortable&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217;
good? Ah, well! maybe: I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re thinkin&#8217;
so. But I &#8217;low I isn&#8217;t much on fetchin&#8217; you up. I&#8217;m
a <i>wonderful</i> poor hand at that. I &#8217;low you&#8217;re gettin&#8217;
a bit beyond me. I been feelin&#8217; sort o&#8217; helpless an&#8217;
scared; an&#8217; I was wishin&#8217; they was somebody t&#8217; lend
a hand with the job. I overhauled ol&#8217; Chesterfield,
Dannie, for comfort; but somehow I wasn&#8217;t able t&#8217;
put my finger on a wonderful lot o&#8217; passages t&#8217; tie to.
He&#8217;ve wonderful good ideas on the subjeck o&#8217; manners,
an&#8217; a raft of un, too; but the ideas he&#8217;ve got on souls,
Dannie, is poor an&#8217; sort o&#8217; damned scarce. So when
I sot down there with the bottle, I &#8217;lowed that if I come
up an&#8217; you give me leave t&#8217; sit on the side o&#8217; your little
bed for a spell, maybe you wouldn&#8217;t mind recitin&#8217; that
there little piece you&#8217;ve fell into the habit o&#8217; usin&#8217; afore
you goes t&#8217; bed. That wee thing about the Shepherd.
You wouldn&#8217;t mind, would you, just sort o&#8217; givin&#8217; it a
light overhaulin&#8217; for me? I&#8217;d thank you, Dannie, an
you would be so kind; an&#8217; I&#8217;ll be as quiet as a mouse
while you does it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The tender Shepherd?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; said he; &#8220;the Shepherd o&#8217; the lambs.&#8221;</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&#8220;&#8216;<i>Jesus, tender Shepherd, hear me;<br />

</td></tr></table>
<p>And now the lower stars were paling in a far-off flush
of light. I had been disquieted, but was by this waxing
glow made glad that the sea and rock of the world
were to lie uncovered of their shadows while yet I was
awake. &#8217;Twas a childish prayer&ndash;&ndash;too simple in terms
and petition (as some may think) for the lad that was
I to utter, grown tall and broad and lusty for my years;
but how sufficient (I recall) to still the fears of night!
They who are grown lads, like the lad that was I, got
somewhat beyond the years of tenderness, cling within
their hearts to all the lost privileges of love they must
by tradition affect to despise. My prayer for the little
lamb that was I presented no aspect of incongruity to
my uncle; it left him silent and solemnly abstracted:
the man being cast into a heavy muse upon its content,
his head fallen over his breast, as was his habit, and
his great gray brows drawn down. How still the night&ndash;&ndash;how
cold and clear: how unfeeling in this frosty
calm and silence, save, afar, where the little stars
winked their kindly cognizance of the wakeful dwellers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
of the earth! I sat up in my bed, peering through the
window, to catch the first glint of the moon and to
watch her rise dripping, as I used to fancy, from the
depths of the sea.</p>
<p>&#8220;But they stray!&#8221; my uncle complained.</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas an utterance most strange. &#8220;Uncle Nick,&#8221; I
asked, &#8220;what is it that strays?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The feet o&#8217; children,&#8221; he answered.</p>
<p>By this I was troubled.</p>
<p>&#8220;They stray,&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;Ay; &#8217;tis as though the
Shepherd minded not at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will my feet stray?&#8221;</p>
<p>He would not answer: and then all at once I was
appalled&ndash;&ndash;who had not feared before.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me!&#8221; I demanded.</p>
<p>He reached out and touched my hand&ndash;&ndash;a fleeting,
diffident touch&ndash;&ndash;and gently answered, &#8220;Ay, lad; your
feet will stray.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; I cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;The feet of all children,&#8221; said he. &#8220;&#8217;Tis the way
o&#8217; the world. They isn&#8217;t mothers&#8217; prayers enough in
all the world t&#8217; change the Shepherd&#8217;s will. He&#8217;s wise&ndash;&ndash;the
Shepherd o&#8217; the lambs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis sad, then,&#8221; I expostulated, &#8220;that the Shepherd
haves it so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sad?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay&ndash;&ndash;wondrous sad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not able t&#8217; think &#8217;tis sad,&#8221; said he. &#8220;&#8217;Tis wise,
Dannie, I&#8217;m thinkin&#8217;, t&#8217; have the lads wander in strange
paths. I&#8217;d not have un suffer fear an&#8217; sorrow, God
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
knows! not one poor lad of all the lads that ever was.
I&#8217;d suffer for their sins meself an&#8217; leave un go scot free.
Not one but I&#8217;d be glad t&#8217; do it for. But still &#8217;tis wise,
I&#8217;m thinkin&#8217;, that they should wander an&#8217; learn for
theirselves the trouble o&#8217; false ways. I wisht,&#8221; he added,
simply, &#8220;that they was another plan&ndash;&ndash;some plan
t&#8217; save un sorrow while yet it made un men. But I
can&#8217;t think o&#8217; none.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But an they&#8217;re lost?&#8221;</p>
<p>He scratched his head in a rush of anxious bewilderment.
&#8220;Why, Dannie,&#8221; cries he, &#8220;it cannot be! Lost?
Some poor wee lads lost? <i>You</i> lost, Dannie? My
God! <i>You</i>, Dannie&ndash;&ndash;you that lies there tender an&#8217;
kind an&#8217; clean o&#8217; soul in your little bed? You that said
the little prayer t&#8217; the tender Shepherd? <i>You</i> lost!
God! it <i>could</i> not be. What&#8217;s this you&#8217;re tellin&#8217; me?
I&#8217;m not able t&#8217; blaspheme the Lord God A&#8217;mighty in
a way that&#8217;s vile as that. Not you, lad&ndash;&ndash;not you!
Am I t&#8217; curse the God that would have it so?&#8221; cries he,
in wrath. &#8220;Am I t&#8217; touch your young body here in
the solemn night, am I t&#8217; look into your unspoiled eyes
by day, an&#8217; feel that you fare into the dark alone, a
child, an&#8217; without hope? <i>Me</i> think that? Ol&#8217; Nick
Top? Not I! Sin? Ay; <i>you&#8217;ll</i> sin. God knows so
well as I you&#8217;ll sin. He made you, lad, an&#8217; knows full
well. You&#8217;ll be sore hurt, child. For all he learns o&#8217;
righteousness, Dannie, a man suffers; an&#8217; for all he
learns o&#8217; sin he pays in kind: &#8217;tis all the same&ndash;&ndash;he
learns o&#8217; good an&#8217; evil an&#8217; pays in the same coin o&#8217;
sorrow. I&#8217;m not wishin&#8217; you sorrow: I&#8217;m wishin&#8217; you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
manhood. You&#8217;ll wander, like all lads, as God knows,
who made un an&#8217; the world they walks in; but the
Shepherd will surely follow an&#8217; fetch home all them
that stray away upon hurtful roads accordin&#8217; t&#8217; the will
He works upon the sons o&#8217; men. They&#8217;s no bog o&#8217; sin
in all the world He knows not of. He&#8217;ll seek the poor
lads out, in patience an&#8217; love; an&#8217; He&#8217;ll cure all the
wounds the world has dealt un in dark places, however
old an&#8217; bleared an&#8217; foul they&#8217;ve growed t&#8217; be, an&#8217; He&#8217;ll
make un clean again, rememberin&#8217; they was little lads,
once&ndash;&ndash;jus&#8217; like you. <i>Why, by God! Dannie,</i>&#8221; cried
he, &#8220;<i>I&#8217;d do as much meself!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; quoth I; &#8220;but the parsons says they&#8217;re lost
for good an&#8217; all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does they?&#8221; he asked, his eyes blank.</p>
<p>&#8220;Deed so&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; often!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, well, Dannie!&#8221; said he, &#8220;bein&#8217; cut off from the
discussion o&#8217; parsons by misdeeds, I&#8217;m not able t&#8217; say.
But bein&#8217; on&#8217;y a lost soul I&#8217;m &#8217;lowed t&#8217; think; an&#8217; I&#8217;ve
thunk a idea.&#8221;</p>
<p>I wondered concerning it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Which is, speakin&#8217; free an&#8217; easy,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that
they lie!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twill be hard,&#8221; I argued, &#8220;&#8217;t save un all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twould be a mean poor God,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;that
couldn&#8217;t manage a little thing like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>My uncle&#8217;s soul, as I had been taught (and but a
moment gone informed), was damned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Nick,&#8221; I inquired, &#8220;will the Shepherd find
you?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Me?&#8221; cries he.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; I persisted; &#8220;will he not seek till he finds
you, too?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hist!&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;I&#8217;m damned, Dannie, for
good an&#8217; all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good Lord, yes!&#8221; said he, under his breath. &#8220;Hist!
Certain sure, I is&ndash;&ndash;damned t&#8217; hell for what I&#8217;m doin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this distant day I know that what he did was all
for me, but not on that moonlit night of my childhood.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; said I.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m damned for it, anyhow,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;Say
no more, Dannie.&#8221;</p>
<p>I marvelled, but could make nothing of it at all.
&#8217;Tis strange (I have since thought) that we damn ourselves
without hesitation: not one worthy man in all
the world counting himself deserving of escape from
those dreadful tortures preached for us by such apostles
of injustice as find themselves, by the laws they have
framed, interpreting without reverence or fear of
blunder, free from the common judgment. Ay, we
damn ourselves; but no man among us damns his
friend, who is as evil as himself. And who damns his
own child? &#8217;Tis no doubt foolish to be vexed by
any philosophy comprehending what is vulgarly
called hell; but still (as I have thought) this is a reasonable
view: there is no hell in the philosophy of
a mother for her own child; and as by beneficent
decree every man is the son of his mother, consequently
there is no hell; else &#8217;twould make such unhappiness
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
in heaven. Ah, well! I looked out of the
window where were the great works of the Lord: His
rock and sea and sky. The moon was there to surprise
me&ndash;&ndash;half risen: the sea shot with a glistening pathway
to the glory of the night. And in that vast uncertain
and inimical place, far out from shore, there rode a
schooner of twenty tons, dawdling unafraid, her small
sails spread for a breeze, in hope. Whither bound?
Northward: an evil coast for sailing-craft&ndash;&ndash;cruel waters:
rock and fog and ice and tempestuous winds. Thither
bound, undaunted, with wings wide, abroad in the
teeth of many perils, come wreck or not. At least
(I thought) she had ventured from snug harbor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dannie,&#8221; said my uncle, &#8220;you&#8217;re all alone in the
world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alone? Not I! &#8220;Why, sir,&#8221; said I, &#8220;I&#8217;ve <i>you!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t I?&#8221; I demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, lad,&#8221; he answered; &#8220;you isn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas the first step he had led me from dependence
upon him. &#8217;Twas as though he had loosened my hand
a little from its confident clasp of his own. I was
alarmed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many&#8217;s the lad,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that thinks he&#8217;ve his
mother; an&#8217; many&#8217;s the mother that thinks she&#8217;ve her
lad. But yet they is both alone&ndash;&ndash;all alone. &#8217;Tis the
queerest thing in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Uncle Nick, I <i>haves</i> you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he persisted; &#8220;you is all alone. Why, Lord!
Dannie, you is &#8217;leven. What does I know about <i>you</i>?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></div>
<p>Not enough.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; what does <i>you</i> know about <i>me</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>I wondered.</p>
<p>&#8220;All children is alone,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Their mothers
doesn&#8217;t think so; but they is. They&#8217;re alone&ndash;&ndash;all
alone. They got t&#8217; walk alone. How am I t&#8217; help
you, Dannie? What can I <i>do</i> for you? Of all the
wisdom I&#8217;ve gathered I&#8217;d give you all an&#8217; go beggared,
but you cannot take one jot. You must walk alone;
&#8217;tis the way o&#8217; the world. An&#8217;, Dannie, could I say t&#8217;
the evil that is abroad, &#8216;Stand back! Make way!
Leave this child o&#8217; mine t&#8217; walk in holiness!&#8217; I would not
speak the word. &#8217;Twould be hard t&#8217; stand helpless
while you was sore beset. I&#8217;m not knowin&#8217; how I&#8217;d
bear it. &#8217;Twould hurt me, Dannie, God knows! But
still I&#8217;d have you walk where sin walks. &#8217;Tis a man&#8217;s
path, an&#8217; I&#8217;d have you take it, lad, like a man. I&#8217;d
not have you come a milk-sop t&#8217; the Gate. I&#8217;d have
you come scathless, an that might be with honor;
but I&#8217;d have you come a man, scarred with a man&#8217;s
scars, an need be. You walk alone, Dannie, God help
you! in the world God made: I&#8217;ve no knowledge o&#8217;
your goings. You&#8217;ll wander far on they small feet.
God grant you may walk manfully wherever they
stray. I&#8217;ve no more t&#8217; hope for than just only that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try, sir,&#8221; said I.</p>
<p>My uncle touched me again&ndash;&ndash;moving nearer, now,
that his hand might lie upon me. &#8220;Dannie,&#8221; he whispered,
&#8220;if you must sin the sins of us&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, sir?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span></div>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll be some poor folk t&#8217; suffer. An&#8217; Dannie&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>I was very grave in the pause.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll not forget t&#8217; be kind, will you,&#8221; he pleaded,
&#8220;t&#8217; them that suffer for your sins?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not sin,&#8221; I protested, &#8220;t&#8217; the hurt of any
others.&#8221;</p>
<p>He seemed not to hear. &#8220;An&#8217; you&#8217;ll bear your own
pain,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;like a man, will you not?&#8221;</p>
<p>I would bear it like a man.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good,&#8221; said he. &#8220;That&#8217;s very good!&#8221;</p>
<p>The moon was now risen from the sea: the room full
of white light.</p>
<p>&#8220;They is a Shepherd,&#8221; said my uncle. &#8220;God be
thanked for that. <i>He&#8217;ll</i> fetch you home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; you?&#8221; said I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Me? Oh no!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll remember,&#8221; said I, confidently, &#8220;that you
was once a little lad&ndash;&ndash;jus&#8217; like me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;God knows!&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>I was then bade go to sleep....</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Presently I fell asleep, but awoke, deep in the night,
to find my uncle brooding in a chair by my bed. The
moon was high in the unclouded heaven. There was
no sound or stirring in all the world&ndash;&ndash;a low, unresting,
melancholy swish and sighing upon the rocks below
my window, where the uneasy sea plainted of some woe
long forgot by all save it, which was like a deeper stillness
and silence. The Lost Soul was lifted old and
solemn and gray in the cold light and shadow of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
night. I was troubled: for my uncle sat in the white
beam, striking in at my window, his eyes staring from
cavernous shadows, his face strangely fixed and woful&ndash;&ndash;drawn,
tragical, set in no incertitude of sorrow and
grievous pain and expectation. I was afraid&ndash;&ndash;&#8217;twas
his eyes: they shook me with fear of the place and
distance from which it seemed he gazed at me. &#8217;Twas
as though a gulf lay between, a place of ghostly depths,
of echoes and jagged rock, dark with wind-blown
shadows. He had brought me far (it seemed) upon a
journey, leading me; and having now set my feet in
other paths and turned my face to a City of Light,
lifted in glory upon a hill, was by some unworthiness
turned back to his own place, but stayed a moment
upon the cloudy cliff at the edge of darkness, with the
night big and thick beyond, to watch me on my way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Nick,&#8221; said I, &#8220;&#8217;tis wonderful late in the
night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, Dannie,&#8221; he answered; &#8220;but I&#8217;m wantin&#8217; sore
t&#8217; sit by you here a spell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not be able,&#8221; I objected, &#8220;t&#8217; go t&#8217; sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twill do no hurt, lad,&#8221; said he &#8220;if I&#8217;m wonderful
quiet. An&#8217; I&#8217;ll be quiet&ndash;&ndash;wonderful quiet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m <i>wantin&#8217;</i> t&#8217; go t&#8217; sleep!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, well,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I&#8217;ll not trouble you, then. I
would not have you lie awake. I&#8217;ll go. Good-night.
God bless you, lad!&#8221;</p>
<p>I wish I had not driven him away....</p>

<h2>VII</h2>
<h3>TWIN ISLANDS</h3>
</div>
<p>In all this time I have said little enough of Twist
Tickle, never a word (I think) of Twin Islands,
between whose ragged shores the sheltering tickle
winds; and by your favor I come now gratefully to
the task. &#8217;Tis a fishing outport: a place of rock and
sea and windy sky&ndash;&ndash;no more than that&ndash;&ndash;but much
loved by the twelvescore simple souls of us, who asked
for share of all the earth but salt-water and a harbor
(with the winds blowing) to thrive sufficient to ourselves
and to the world beyond. Had my uncle sought
a secret place to foster the child that was I&ndash;&ndash;which yet
might yield fair wage for toil&ndash;&ndash;his quest fortuitously
ended when the <i>Shining Light</i> ran dripping out of the
gale and came to anchor in the quiet water of the
tickle. But more like &#8217;twas something finer that moved
him: in that upheaval of his life, it may be, &#8217;twas a
wistful turning of the heart to the paths and familiar
waters of the shore where he lived as a lad. Had the
<i>Shining Light</i> sailed near or far and passed the harbor
by, the changed fortunes of&ndash;&ndash;but there was no
sailing by, nor could have been, for the great wind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
upon whose wings she came was passionate, too, and
fateful.</p>
<p>If &#8217;tis a delight to love, whatever may come of it (as
some hold), I found delight upon the grim hills of
Twin Islands....</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>They lie hard by the coast, but are yet remote:
Ship&#8217;s Run divides them from the long blue line of
main-land which lifts its barren hills in misty distance
from our kinder place. &#8217;Tis a lusty stretch of gray
water, sullen, melancholy, easily troubled by the winds,
which delight, it seems, sweeping from the drear seas
of the north, to stir its rage. In evil weather &#8217;tis wide
as space; when a nor&#8217;easter lifts the white dust of the
sea, clouding Blow-me-down-Billy of the main-land in
a swirl of mist and spume, there is no departure; nor
is there any crossing (mark you) when in the spring of
the year a southerly gale urges the ice to sea. We of
Twin Islands were cut off by Ship&#8217;s Run from all the
stirring and inquisitive world.</p>
<p>According to Tumm, the clerk of the <i>Quick as Wink</i>,
which traded our harbor, Twin Islands are t&#8217; the west&#8217;ard
o&#8217; the Scarf o&#8217; Fog, a bit below the Blue Gravestones,
where the <i>Soldier o&#8217; the Cross</i> was picked up
by Satan&#8217;s Tail in the nor&#8217;easter o&#8217; the Year o&#8217; the
Big Shore Catch. &#8220;Oh, I knows un!&#8221; says he. &#8220;You
opens the Tickle when you rounds Cocked Hat o&#8217; the
Hen-an&#8217;-Chickens an&#8217; lays a course for Gentleman
Cove, t&#8217;other side o&#8217; the bay. Good harbor in dirty
weather,&#8221; says he: &#8220;an&#8217;, ecod! my lads, a hearty folk.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
This is forbidding enough, God knows! as to situation;
but though the ancient islands, scoured by wind and
rain, are set in a misty isolation and show gray, grimly
wrinkled faces to the unkind sea, betraying no tenderness,
they are green and genial in the places within:
there are valleys; and the sun is no idler, and the lean
earth of those parts is not to be discouraged.</p>
<p>&#8220;God-forsaken place, Nick!&#8221; quoth Tom Bull, at the
Anchor and Chain.</p>
<p>&#8220;How was you knowin&#8217; that, Tom?&#8221; says my uncle.
&#8220;You isn&#8217;t never <i>been</i> there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Sounds</i> God-forsaken.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So does hell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, hell <i>is</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There you goes again, Tom Bull!&#8221; cries my uncle,
with a sniff and wrathful twitch of the lip. &#8220;There you
goes again, you dunderhead&ndash;&ndash;jumpin&#8217; t&#8217; conclusions!&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom Bull was shocked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hell God-forsaken!&#8221; growls my uncle. &#8220;They&#8217;s
more hard labor for the good Lord t&#8217; do in hell, Tom
Bull, than any place I knows on; an&#8217; I &#8217;low He&#8217;s
right there, kep&#8217; double watches on the jump, a-doin&#8217;
of it!&#8221;</p>
<p>Twist Tickle pursues an attenuated way between
the Twins, broadening into the harbor basin beyond
the Pillar o&#8217; Cloud, narrowing at the Finger and Thumb,
widening, once more, into the lower harbor, and escaping
to the sea, at last, between Pretty Willie and the
Lost Soul, which are great bare heads. You get a
glimpse of the Tickle from the deck of the mail-boat:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
this when she rounds the Cocked Hat and wallows off
towards Gentleman Cove. &#8217;Tis but a niggardly glimpse
at best, and vastly unfair to the graces of the place: a
white house, wee and listlessly tilted, gripping a rock,
as with expiring interest; a reach of placid water, deep
and shadowy, from which rise the hills, gray, rugged,
splashed with green; heights beyond, scarfed with
clinging wisps of mist.</p>
<p>The white houses are builded in a fashion the most
disorderly at the edge of the tickle, strung clear from
the narrows to the Lost Soul and straying somewhat
upon the slopes, with the scrawny-legged flakes clinging
to the bare declivities and the stages squatted at
the water-side; but some houses, whose tenants are
solitary folk made morose by company, congregate in
the remoter coves&ndash;&ndash;where the shore is the shore of the
open sea and there is no crowd to trouble&ndash;&ndash;whence
paths scramble over the hills to the Tickle settlement.
My uncle&#8217;s cottage sat respectably, even with some
superiority, upon a narrow neck of rock by the Lost
Soul, outlooking, westerly, to sea, but in the opposite
direction dwelling in a way more intimate and fond
upon the unruffled water of Old Wives&#8217; Cove, within
the harbor, where rode the <i>Shining Light</i>.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; there she&#8217;ll lie,&#8221; he was used to saying, with a
grave and mysteriously significant wink, &#8220;until I&#8217;ve
sore need o&#8217; she.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; said they, &#8220;or till she rots, plank an&#8217;
strand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An she rots,&#8221; says my uncle, &#8220;she may rot: for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
she&#8217;ll sail these here waters, sound or rotten, by the
Lord! an I just put her to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unhappy, then, perhaps, Twin Islands, in situation
and prospect; but the folk of that harbor, who deal
barehanded with wind and sea to catch fish, have this
wisdom: that a barren, a waste of selfish water, a low,
soggy sky have nothing to do with the hearts of men,
which are independent, in love and hope and present
content, of these unfeeling things. We were seafaring
men, every jack of the place, with no knowledge of a
world apart from green water, which forever confronted
us, fashioning our lives; but we played the old
comedy as heartily, with feeling as true and deep, the
same fine art, as you, my gentlefolk! and made a
spectacle as grateful to the gods for whom the stage
(it seems) is set.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>And there is a road from the Tickle to the sea&ndash;&ndash;to
an outer cove, high-cliffed, frothy, sombre, with many
melancholy echoes of wind and breakers and listless
human voices, where is a cluster of hopeless, impoverished
homes. &#8217;Tis a wilful-minded path, lingering
indolently among the hills, artful, intimate, wise with
age, and most indulgently secretive of its soft discoveries.
It is used to the lagging feet of lovers. There are valleys
in its length, and winding, wooded stretches, kindly
places; and there are arching alders along the way to
provide a seclusion yet more tender. In the moonlight
&#8217;tis a path of enchantment&ndash;&ndash;a way (as I know) of pain
and high delight: of a wandering hope that tantalizes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
but must in faith, as we are men, be followed to its
catastrophe. I have suffered much of ecstasy and
despair upon that path. &#8217;Tis the road to Whisper
Cove.</p>
<p>Judith dwelt at Whisper Cove....</p>

<h3>A MAID O&#8217; WHISPER COVE</h3>
</div>
<p>Fourteen, then, and something more: a footloose
lad of Twist Tickle&ndash;&ndash;free to sail and wander,
to do and dream, to read the riddles of my years,
blithe and unalarmed. &#8217;Tis beyond the will and wish
of me to forget the day I lay upon the Knob o&#8217; Lookout,
from afar keeping watch on the path to Whisper
Cove&ndash;&ndash;the taste of it, salty and cool, the touch of it
upon my cheek and in my hair, the sunlight and scampering
wind: the simple haps and accidents, the perception,
awakening within me, and the portent. &#8217;Twas
blowing high and merrily from the west&ndash;&ndash;a yellow
wind from the warm west and from the golden mist
and low blue line of coast at the other side of the
bay. It rippled the azure floor between, and flung the
spray of the breakers into the sunshine, and heartily
clapped the gray cliff, and pulled the ears of the
spruce, and went swinging on, in joyous mood, to the
gray spaces of the great sea beyond Twin Islands. I
shall not forget: for faith! the fates were met in conspiracy
with the day to plot the mischief of my life.
There was no warning, no question to ease the issue
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
in my case: &#8217;twas all ordained in secret; and the lever
of destiny was touched, and the labor of the unfeeling
loom went forward to weave the pattern of my days.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Judith (as I know) washed her mother&#8217;s face and
hands with conscientious care: &#8217;twas her way. Doubtless,
in the way she had, she chattered, the while, a
torrent of affectionate reproof and direction, which gave
no moment for promise or complaint, and at last, with
a raised finger and a masterful little flash of the eye,
bade the flighty woman keep out of mischief for the
time. What then, &#8217;tis easy to guess: she exhausted
the resources of soap and water in her own adornment
(for she smelled of suds in the cabin of the <i>Shining
Light</i>), and set out by the path from Whisper Cove to
Twist Tickle, with never a glance behind, but a prim,
sharp outlook, from shyly downcast eyes, upon all the
world ahead. A staid, slim little maid, with softly
fashioned shoulders, carried sedately, her small head
drooping with shy grace, like a flower upon its slender
stalk, seeming as she went her dainty way to perceive
neither scene nor incident of the passage, but yet
observing all in swift, sly little flashes.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; a-ha!&#8221; thinks I, &#8220;she&#8217;s bound for the <i>Shining
Light</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was blowing: on the edge of the cliff, where the
path was lifted high above the sea, winding through
sunlit space, the shameless old wind, turned skyward
by the gray cliff, made bold, in the way the wind knows
and will practise, wherever it blows. The wind cared
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
nothing for the tragic possibility of a lad on the path:
Judith was but a fluttering rag in the gust. At once&ndash;&ndash;&#8217;twas
a miracle of activity&ndash;&ndash;her face reappeared in a
cloud of calico and tawny hair. She looked fearfully
to the path and yellow hills; and her eyes (it must be)
were wide with the distress of this adventure, and there
were blushes (I know) upon her cheeks, and a flash of
white between her moist red lips. Without hint of the
thing (in her way)&ndash;&ndash;as though recklessly yielding to
delight despite her fears&ndash;&ndash;she lifted her hands and
abandoned the pinafore to the will of the wind with a
frightened little chuckle. &#8217;Twas her way: thus in a
flash to pass from nay to yea without mistrust or lingering.
Presently, tired of the space and breeze, she
dawdled on in the sunshine, idling with the berries
and scrawny flowers by the way, and with the gulls,
winging above the sea, until, as with settled intention,
she vanished over the cliff by the goat-path to Old
Wives&#8217; Cove, where rode the <i>Shining Light</i>, sound
asleep under a blanket of sunshine in the lee of the
Lost Soul.</p>
<p>I followed.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>In the cabin of the <i>Shining Light</i>, cross-legged on
the table, in the midst of the order she had accomplished,
her hands neatly folded in her lap, Judith sat
serene. She had heard my clatter on the gang-plank,
my shuffle and heavy tread on the deck. &#8217;Twas I, she
knew: there was no mistaking, God help me! the fall
of my feet on road or deck. It may be that her heart
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
for a moment fluttered to know that the lad that was
I came at last. She has not told me: I do not know.
But faith! my own was troublesome enough with a
new and irritating uneasiness, for which was no accounting.</p>
<p>I feigned astonishment. &#8220;Hello!&#8221; quoth I; &#8220;what
you doin&#8217; here?&#8221;</p>
<p>She turned away&ndash;&ndash;the eager expectation all fled from
her face: I saw it vanish.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>She sniffed: &#8217;twas a frank sniff of contempt&ndash;&ndash;pain,
like a half-heard sob, mixed with the scorn of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;What you doin&#8217; here?&#8221;</p>
<p>I stood reproached; she had achieved it in a glance&ndash;&ndash;a
little shaft of light, darting upon me, departing, having
dealt its wound.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, maid,&#8221; cries I, the smart of her glance and
silence enraging me, &#8220;is you got no tongue?&#8221;</p>
<p>She puckered her brows, pursed her lips; she sighed&ndash;&ndash;and
concerned herself with her hair-ribbon, quite
placid once more. &#8217;Twas a trick well known to me.
&#8217;Twas a trick aggravating to the temper. &#8217;Twas a
maid&#8217;s trick&ndash;&ndash;an ensnaring, deadly trick. &#8217;Twas a
trick ominous of my imminent confusion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221; I demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dannie, child,&#8221; she admonished, gently, &#8220;God hates
a liar!&#8221;</p>
<p>I might have known.</p>
<p>&#8220;T&#8217; make believe,&#8221; cries she, &#8220;that I&#8217;d not be here!
How could you!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span></div>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis not a lie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis a white lie, child,&#8221; she chided. &#8220;You&#8217;ve come,
Dannie, poor lad! t&#8217; be a white liar. &#8217;Tis a woful
state&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; a parlous thing. For, child, if you keeps
on&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She had paused. &#8217;Twas a trick to fetch the question.
I asked it.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be a blue one,&#8221; says she. &#8220;An&#8217; then&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Blue-black, child. An&#8217; then&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>I waited.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Dannie, lad!&#8221; cries she, her little hands clasped,
a pitiful quaver in her voice, so that I felt consigned to
woe, indeed, for this misdoing, &#8220;you&#8217;ll be a liar as
black as&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no more of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;You dare not say it!&#8221; I taunted.</p>
<p>I did not wish that she should: not I! but still, being
a lad, would have her come close enough to sauce the
devil. But I would not have her say that word. Indeed,
I need not have troubled. &#8217;Twas not in her mind
to be so unmaidenly, with a lad at hand to serve her
purpose.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; says she, &#8220;I dare not; but you, Dannie, bein&#8217;
a lad&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Her voice trailed off expectantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Black as hell?&#8221;</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, maid,&#8221; says I, &#8220;you&#8217;ve called me a liar.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t wantin&#8217; to.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span></div>
<p>&#8220;No odds,&#8221; says I. &#8220;An&#8217; if I&#8217;m a liar,&#8221; says I, &#8220;I
&#8217;low I&#8217;m a fool for it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, my maid,&#8221; cries I, in triumph, &#8220;you&#8217;ll be
keepin&#8217; me company in hell! You&#8217;ve called me a fool.
&#8216;An&#8217; whoso calleth his brother a fool&ndash;&ndash;&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh no,&#8221; says she, quite undisturbed. &#8220;&#8217;Tis not so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, no, child! Didn&#8217;t you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it <i>says</i> so!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dannie, child,&#8221; says she, with unruffled superiority,
&#8220;I come down from heaven one year an&#8217; five months
after God sent you. An&#8217; God <i>told</i> me, Dannie, just
afore I left Un at the Gate, that He&#8217;d changed His
mind about that.&#8221;</p>
<p>The particular color of this stupendous prevarication
I am still unable to determine....</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Here in the cabin of the <i>Shining Light</i> was my workshop.
On the bench, stout-hulled and bravely masted,
was a bark to be rigged. My fingers itched to be
dealing with the delicate labor. &#8217;Twas no time now,
thought I, all at once, to dally with the child. The
maid was a sweet maid, an amiably irritating maid,
well enough, in her way, to idle with; but the building
of the ship was a substantial delight, subject to the
mastery of a man with hands and a will, the end a
sure achievement&ndash;&ndash;no vague, elusive thing, sought in
madness, vanishing in the grasp. I would be about
this man&#8217;s-work. Never was such a ship as this ship
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
should be! And to the work went Judith and I. But
presently, as never happened before, I was in some
strange way conscious of Judith&#8217;s nearness. &#8217;Twas a
soft, companionable presence, indeed! I bungled the
knots, and could no longer work my will upon the
perverse spars, but had rather dwell upon her slender
hands, swiftly, capably busy, her tawny hair, her sun-browned
cheeks and the creamy curve of her brow, the
blue and flash and fathomless depths of her eyes. I
remembered the sunlight and freshening breeze upon
the hills, the chirp and gentle stirring of the day, the
azure sea and far-off, tender mist, the playful breakers,
flinging spray high into the yellow sunshine. &#8217;Twas
no time now, thought I, to be busied with craft in the
gloomy cabin of the <i>Shining Light</i>, which was all well
enough in its way; &#8217;twas a time to be abroad in the
sunlit wind. And I sighed: not knowing what ailed
me, but yet uneasy and most melancholy. The world
was an ill place for a lad to be (thinks I), and all the
labor of it a vanity....</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Now the afternoon was near spent. My hands were
idle&ndash;&ndash;my eyes and heart far astray from the labor of
the time. It was very still and dreamful in the cabin.
The chinks were red with the outer glow, and a stream
of mote-laden sunlight, aslant, came in at the companionway.</p>
<p>It fell upon Judith.</p>
<p>&#8220;Judy,&#8221; I whispered, bending close, &#8220;I &#8217;low I might
as well&ndash;&ndash;might as well have&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span></div>
<p>She looked up in affright.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have a kiss,&#8221; said I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh no!&#8221; she gasped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not? Sure I&#8217;m able for it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; she answered, in her wisdom yielding this;
&#8220;but, Dannie, child, &#8217;tisn&#8217;t <i>&#8217;lowed</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her eyes turned round with religious awe. &#8220;God,&#8221;
said she, with a solemn wag, &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t like it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d never stop for that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;May be,&#8221; she chided; &#8220;but I &#8217;low, lad, we ought
t&#8217; &#8217;blige Un once in a while. &#8217;Tis no more than kind.
An&#8217; what&#8217;s a kiss t&#8217; lack? Pooh!&#8221;</p>
<p>I was huffed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, well, then!&#8221; said she, &#8220;an your heart&#8217;s set on
it, Dannie, I&#8217;ve no mind t&#8217; stop you. But&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>I moved forward, abashed, but determined.</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; she continued, with an emphasis that brought
me to a stop, &#8220;I &#8217;low I better ask God, t&#8217; make sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas the way she had in emergencies.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do,&#8221; said I, dolefully.</p>
<p>The God of the lad that was I&ndash;&ndash;the God of his
childish vision, when, in the darkness of night, he lifted
his eyes in prayer, seeking the leading of a Shepherd&ndash;&ndash;was
a forbidding God: white, gigantic, in the shape of
an old, old man, the Ancient of Days, in a flowing robe,
seated scowling upon a throne, aloft on a rolling cloud,
with an awful mist of darkness all roundabout. But
Judith, as I knew, visualized in a more felicitous way.
The God to whom she appealed was a rotund, florid
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
old gentleman, with the briefest, most wiry of sandy
whiskers upon his chops, a jolly double chin, a sunburned
nose, kindly blue eyes forever opened in mild
wonder (and a bit bleared by the wind), the fat figure
clad in broadly checked tweed knickerbockers and a
rakish cap to match, like the mad tourists who sometimes
strayed our way. &#8217;Twas this complacent, benevolent
Deity that she made haste to interrogate in
my behalf, unabashed by the spats and binocular, the
corpulent plaid stockings and cigar, which completed
his attire. She spread her feet, in the way she had at
such times; and she shut her eyes, and she set her
teeth, and she clinched her hands, and thus silently
began to wrestle for the answer, her face all screwed,
as by a taste of lemon.<a name='FNanchor_0004' id='FNanchor_0004'></a><a href='#Footnote_0004' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a></p>
<p>Presently my patience was worn.</p>
<p>&#8220;What news?&#8221; I inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hist!&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;He&#8217;s lookin&#8217; at me through
His glasses.&#8221;</p>
<p>I waited an interval.</p>
<p>&#8220;What now, Judy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hist!&#8221; says she. &#8220;He&#8217;s wonderful busy makin&#8217; up
His mind. Leave Un be, Dannie!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas trying, indeed! I craved the kiss. Nor by
watching the child&#8217;s puckered face could I win a hint
to ease the suspense that rode me. Upon the will of
Judith&#8217;s Lord God Almighty in tweed knickerbockers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
surely depended the disposition of the maid. I wished
He would make haste to answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Judy, maid,&#8221; I implored, &#8220;will He never have
done?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be makin&#8217; Un mad, Dannie,&#8221; she warned.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can wait no longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s scowlin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>I wished I had not interrupted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I &#8217;low,&#8221; she reported, &#8220;He&#8217;ll shake His head in a
minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas a tender way to break ill news.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; she sighed, opening her eyes. &#8220;He&#8217;ve gone
an&#8217; done it. I knowed it. He&#8217;ve said I hadn&#8217;t better
not. I&#8217;m wonderful sorry you&#8217;ve t&#8217; lack the kiss,
Dannie. I&#8217;m wonderful sorry, Dannie,&#8221; she repeated,
in a little quiver of pity, &#8220;for <i>you</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>She was pitiful: there&#8217;s no forgetting that compassion,
its tearful concern and wistfulness. I was bewildered.
More wishful beseeching must surely have
softened a Deity with a sunburned nose and a double
chin! Indeed, I was bewildered by this fantasy of
weeping and nonsense. For the little break in her
voice and the veil of tears upon her eyes I cannot
account. &#8217;Twas the way she had as a maid: and concerning
this I have found it folly to speculate. Of the
boundaries of sincerity and pretence within her heart
I have no knowledge. There was no pretence (I think);
&#8217;twas all reality&ndash;&ndash;the feigning and the feeling&ndash;&ndash;for
Judith walked in a confusion of the truths of life with
visions. There came a time&ndash;&ndash;a moment in our lives&ndash;&ndash;when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
there was no feigning. &#8217;Twas a kiss besought;
and &#8217;twas kiss or not, as between a man and a maid,
with no Almighty in tweed knickerbockers conveniently
at hand to shoulder the blame. Ah, well, Judith! the
golden, mote-laden shaft which transfigured your childish
loveliness into angelic glory, the encompassing
shadows, the stirring of the day without, the winds of
blue weather blowing upon the hills, are beauties faded
long ago, the young denial a pain almost forgot. The
path we trod thereafter, Judith, is a memory, too: the
days and nights of all the years since in the streaming
sunlight of that afternoon the lad that was I looked
upon you to find the shadowy chambers of your eyes
all misty with compassion.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&#8220;Dannie,&#8221; she ventured, softly, &#8220;you&#8217;re able t&#8217; take
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay&ndash;&ndash;but will not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re wonderful strong, Dannie, an&#8217; I&#8217;m but a
maid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll wrest no kisses,&#8221; said I, with a twitch of scorn,
&#8220;from maids.&#8221;</p>
<p>She smiled. &#8217;Twas a passing burst of rapture,
which, vanishing, left her wan and aged beyond her
years.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she whispered, but not to me, &#8220;he&#8217;d <i>not</i> do
that. He&#8217;d not&ndash;&ndash;do that! An&#8217; I&#8217;d care little enough
for the Dannie Callaway that would.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You cares little enough as &#8217;tis,&#8221; said I. &#8220;You
cares nothing at all. You cares not a jot.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span></div>
<p>She smiled again: but now as a wilful, flirting maid.
&#8220;As for carin&#8217; for <i>you</i>, Dannie,&#8221; she mused, dissembling
candor, &#8220;I <i>do</i>&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; I don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>The unholy spell that a maid may weave! The
shameless trickery of this!</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you,&#8221; she added, &#8220;the morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>And she would keep me in torture!</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;ll be no to-morrow for we,&#8221; I flashed, in a
passion. &#8220;You cares nothing for Dannie Callaway.
&#8217;Tis my foot,&#8221; I cried, stamping in rage and resentment.
&#8220;&#8217;Tis my twisted foot. I&#8217;m nothin&#8217; but a
cripple!&#8221;</p>
<p>She cried out at this.</p>
<p>&#8220;A limpin&#8217; cripple,&#8221; I groaned, &#8220;t&#8217; be laughed at by
all the maids o&#8217; Twist Tickle!&#8221;</p>
<p>She began now softly to weep. I moved towards the
ladder&ndash;&ndash;with the will to abandon her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dannie,&#8221; she called, &#8220;take the kiss.&#8221;</p>
<p>I would not.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take two,&#8221; she begged.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maid,&#8221; said I, severely, &#8220;what about your God?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, <i>but</i>&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; she began.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; cries I. &#8220;None o&#8217; that, now!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll not listen!&#8221; she pouted.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twill never do, maid!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An you&#8217;d but hear me, child,&#8221; she complained, &#8220;I&#8217;d
&#8217;splain&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>What about your God?</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>She turned demure&ndash;&ndash;all in a flash. &#8220;I&#8217;ll ask Un,&#8221;
said she, most piously. &#8220;You&ndash;&ndash;you&ndash;&ndash;you&#8217;ll not run
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
off, Dannie,&#8221; she asked, faintly, &#8220;when I&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;shuts
my eyes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bide here,&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; says she, &#8220;I&#8217;ll ask Un.&#8221;</p>
<p>The which she did, in her peculiar way. &#8217;Twas a
ceremony scandalously brief and hurried. Once I
caught (I thought) a slit in her eye&ndash;&ndash;a peep-hole through
which she spied upon me. Presently she looked up
with a shy little grin. &#8220;God says, Dannie,&#8221; she reported,
speaking with slow precision, the grin now
giving place to an expression of solemnity and highest
rapture, &#8220;that He &#8217;lows He didn&#8217;t know what a fuss
you&#8217;d make about a little thing like a kiss. He&#8217;ve been
wonderful bothered o&#8217; late by overwork, Dannie, an&#8217;
He&#8217;s sorry for what He done, an&#8217; &#8217;lows you might overlook
it this time. &#8216;You tell Dannie, Judy,&#8217; says He,
&#8216;that he&#8217;ve simply no idea what a God like me haves t&#8217;
put up with. They&#8217;s a woman t&#8217; Thunder Arm,&#8217; says
He, &#8216;that&#8217;s been worryin&#8217; me night an&#8217; day t&#8217; keep her
baby from dyin&#8217;, an&#8217; I simply can&#8217;t make up my mind.
She&#8217;ll make me mad an she doesn&#8217;t look out,&#8217; says He,
&#8216;an&#8217; then I&#8217;ll kill it. An&#8217; I&#8217;ve the heathen, Judy&ndash;&ndash;all
them heathen&ndash;&ndash;on my mind. &#8217;Tis enough t&#8217; drive any
God mad. An&#8217; jus&#8217; now,&#8217; says He, &#8216;I&#8217;ve got a wonderful
big gale blowin&#8217; on the Labrador, an&#8217; I&#8217;m near drove
deaf,&#8217; says He, &#8216;by the noise them fishermen is makin&#8217;.
What with the Labradormen an&#8217; the woman t&#8217; Thunder
Arm an&#8217; the heathen &#8217;tis fair awful. An&#8217; now comes
Dannie,&#8217; says He, &#8216;t&#8217; make me sick o&#8217; my berth! You
tell Dannie,&#8217; says he, &#8216;t&#8217; take the kiss an&#8217; be done with it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
Tell un t&#8217; go ahead,&#8217; says He, &#8216;an&#8217; not be afeared o&#8217; me.
I isn&#8217;t in favor o&#8217; kissin&#8217; as a usual thing,&#8217; says He,
&#8216;for I&#8217;ve always &#8217;lowed &#8217;twas sort o&#8217; silly; but if <i>you</i>
don&#8217;t mind, Judy,&#8217; says He, &#8216;why, <i>I</i> can turn my head.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas not persuasive.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis a white kiss,&#8221; said she, seeking, in her way,
to deck the thing with attractions.</p>
<p>I would not turn.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis all silk.&#8221;</p>
<p>It budged me not, though I craved the kiss with a
mounting sense of need, a vision of despair. It budged
me not: I would not be beguiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; oh, Dannie!&#8221; she besought, with her hands
appealing, &#8220;&#8217;tis <i>awful</i> expensive!&#8221;</p>
<p>I returned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take it,&#8221; she sobbed.</p>
<p>I pecked her lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Volume II., page 26!&#8221; roared my uncle, his broad
red face appearing at that moment in the companionway.
&#8220;You done well, Dannie! &#8217;Tis quite t&#8217; the taste
o&#8217; Skipper Chesterfield. You&#8217;re sailin&#8217; twelve knots by
the log, lad, on the course you&#8217;re steerin&#8217;!&#8221;</p>
<p>So I did not have another; but the one, you may
believe! had done the mischief.</p>

<h2>IX</h2>
<h3>AN AFFAIR OF THE HEART</h3>
</div>
<p>My uncle&#8217;s errand, speedily made known, for
Judith&#8217;s restoration, was this: to require my
presence betimes at tea that evening, since (as he
said) there was one coming by the mail-boat whom
he would have me favorably impress with my appearance
and state of gentility&ndash;&ndash;a thing I was by no means
loath to do, having now grown used to the small delights
of display. But I was belated, as it chanced,
after all: for having walked with Judith, by my uncle&#8217;s
hint, to the cairn at the crest of Tom Tulk&#8217;s Head,
upon the return I fell in with Moses Shoos, the fool
of Twist Tickle, who would have me bear him company
to Eli Flack&#8217;s cottage, in a nook beyond the
Finger, and lend him comfort thereafter, in good or
evil fortune, as might befall. To this I gave a glad
assent, surmising from the significant conjunction of
smartened attire and doleful countenance that an affair
of the heart was forward. And &#8217;twas true; &#8217;twas
safely to be predicted, indeed, in season and out, of
the fool of our harbor: for what with his own witless
conjectures and the reports of his mates, made in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
unkind banter, his leisure was forever employed in
the unhappy business: so that never a strange maid
came near but he would go shyly forth upon his quest,
persuaded of a grateful issue. &#8217;Twas heroic, I thought,
and by this, no less than by his attachment, he was
endeared to me.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>I sniffed a change of wind as we fell in together.
&#8217;Twould presently switch to the south (I fancied);
and &#8217;twould blow high from the sou&#8217;east before the
night was done. The shadows were already long;
and in the west&ndash;&ndash;above the hills which shut the sea
from sight&ndash;&ndash;the blue of mellow weather and of the
day was fading. And by the lengthened shadows I
was reminded that &#8217;twas an untimely errand the fool
was upon. &#8220;&#8217;Tis a queer time,&#8221; said I, &#8220;t&#8217; be goin&#8217; t&#8217;
Eli&#8217;s. Sure, Moses, they&#8217;ll be at the board!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear man! but I&#8217;m wonderful crafty, Dannie,&#8221; he
explained, with a sly twitch of the eye. &#8220;An they&#8217;re
at table, lad, with fish an&#8217; brewis sot out, I&#8217;m sure t&#8217;
cotch the maid within.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The maid?&#8221; I inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, lad; &#8217;tis a maid. I&#8217;m told they&#8217;s a new baggage
come t&#8217; Skipper Eli&#8217;s for a bit of a cruise.&#8221;</p>
<p>I caught a bashful flush mounting to his ears and the
rumble of a chuckle in his throat.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ve come from Tall Pine Harbor,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;with a cask o&#8217; liver; an&#8217; I&#8217;m told she&#8217;ve her heart
dead sot on matrimony.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Larry Hull&#8217;s maid?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span></div>
<p>&#8220;No, lad; &#8217;tis not she. She&#8217;ve declined. Las&#8217; fall,
Dannie, bein&#8217; wind-bound in a easterly gale, I cotched
she at Skipper Jonathan Stark&#8217;s. No; she&#8217;ve declined.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis Maria Long, then,&#8221; said I.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, lad; she&#8217;ve declined, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Elizabeth Wutt?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ve declined.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis not the Widow Tootle!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; <i>she&#8217;ve</i> declined,&#8221; he answered, dismally.
&#8220;But,&#8221; he added, with a sudden access of cheerfulness,
&#8220;she come wonderful <i>near</i> it. &#8217;Twas a close call for
she! She &#8217;lowed, Dannie, that an my beard had been
red she might ha&#8217; went an&#8217; done it, takin&#8217; chances with
my wits. She might, says she, put up with a lack o&#8217;
wit; but a beard o&#8217; proper color she must have for
peace o&#8217; mind. You sees, Dannie, Sam Tootle had a
red beard, an&#8217; the widow &#8217;lowed she&#8217;d feel strange with
a yellow one, bein&#8217; accustomed t&#8217; the other for twenty
year. She&#8217;ve declined, &#8217;tis true; but she come wonderful
<i>near</i> t&#8217; sayin the word. &#8217;Twas quite encouragin&#8217;,&#8221;
he added, then sighed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You keep on, Moses,&#8221; said I, to hearten him, &#8220;an&#8217;
you&#8217;ll manage it yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; he sighed, &#8220;used t&#8217; &#8217;low so.&#8221;</p>
<p>We were now come to a rise in the road, whence,
looking back, I found the sky fast clouding up. &#8217;Twas
a wide view, falling between the black, jagged masses
of Pretty Willie and the Lost Soul, cast in shadow&ndash;&ndash;a
reach of blood-red sea, with mounting clouds at the
edge of the world, into which the swollen sun had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
dropped, to set the wind-blown tatters in a flare of red
and gold. &#8217;Twas all a sullen black below, tinged with
purple and inky blue; but high above the flame and
glow of the rags of cloud there hung a mottled sky,
each fleecy puff a touch of warmer color upon the pale
green beyond. The last of our folk were bound in
from the grounds, with the brown sails spread to a
rising breeze, the fleet of tiny craft converging upon
the lower-harbor tickle; presently the men would be
out of the roughening sea, pulling up the harbor to the
stage-heads, there to land and split the catch. Ay, a
change of wind, a switch to the sou&#8217;east, with the
threat of a gale with rain; &#8217;twould blow before dark,
no doubt, and &#8217;twas now all dusky in the east, where
the sky was cold and gray. Soon the lamps would be
alight in the kitchens of our harbor, where the men
folk, cleansed of the sweat of the sea, would sit warm
and dry with their wives and rosy lads and maids,
caring not a whit for the wind and rain without, since
they had what they had within.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m knowin&#8217; no other maid at Tall Pine Harbor,&#8221;
said I, &#8220;that&#8217;s fit t&#8217; wed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis a maid o&#8217; the name o&#8217; Pearl,&#8221; he confided;
&#8220;an&#8217; I&#8217;m told she&#8217;s fair on looks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pearl what, Moses?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I disremember, Dannie,&#8221; he answered, a bit put
out. &#8220;The lads told me, out there on the grounds
the day, when I got wind of her bein&#8217; here, but I&#8217;ve
clean forgot. It won&#8217;t matter, anyhow, will it, lad?
for, sure, I&#8217;m able t&#8217; <i>ask</i>.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span></div>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; you&#8217;ve hopes?&#8221;</p>
<p>He trudged on, staring straight ahead, now silent
and downcast. &#8220;Well, no, Dannie,&#8221; he answered, at
last, &#8220;not what you might call <i>hopes</i>. So many,
Dannie, haves declined, that I&#8217;d be s&#8217;prised t&#8217; cotch
one that wouldn&#8217;t slip the hook. But not havin&#8217; cast
for this one, lad, I&#8217;ve not give up. I&#8217;m told they&#8217;s no
wonderful demand for the maid on accounts of temper
and cross-eyes; an&#8217; so I was sort of allowin&#8217; she <i>might</i>
have a mind t&#8217; try a fool, him bein&#8217; the on&#8217;y skipper t&#8217;
hand. Mother used t&#8217; say if I kep&#8217; on she &#8217;lowed I&#8217;d
haul one out in the end: an&#8217; I &#8217;low mother knowed.
She never &#8217;lowed I&#8217;d cotch a perfeck specimen, in p&#8217;int
o&#8217; looks, for them, says she, mates accordin&#8217; t&#8217; folly;
but she did say, Dannie, that the maid I wed would
come t&#8217; know me jus&#8217; the way mother knowed me, an
t&#8217; love me jus&#8217; the way mother loved me, for my goodness.
&#8217;Twas kind o&#8217; mother t&#8217; think it: nobody else,
Dannie, was ever so kind t&#8217; me. I wonder why <i>she</i>
was! Would you say, Dannie,&#8221; he asked, turning
anxiously, &#8220;that a cross-eyed maid <i>could</i> be fair on
looks? Not,&#8221; he added, quickly, &#8220;that I&#8217;d care a
wonderful sight: for mother used t&#8217; say that looks
wiped off in the first washin&#8217;, anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>I did not answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t say, would you, lad,&#8221; he went on,
&#8220;that <i>I</i> was fair on looks?&#8221;</p>
<p>An ungainly little man, this Moses Shoos: stout
enough about the chest, where a man&#8217;s strength needs
lie, big-shouldered, long-armed, but scrawny and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
crooked in the legs and of an inconfident, stumbling
gait, prone to halt, musing vacantly as he went. He
was bravely clad upon his courtship: a suit of homespun
from the <i>Quick as Wink</i>, given in fair dealing,
as to quality, by Tumm, the clerk, but with reservations
as to fit&ndash;&ndash;everywhere (it seemed) unequal to its
task, in particular at the wrists and lean shanks. His
visage was in the main of a gravely philosophical cast,
full at the forehead, pensive about the eyes, restless-lipped,
covered upon cheeks and chin with a close,
curly growth of yellow beard of a color with his hair:
&#8217;twas as though, indeed, he carried a weight of thought&ndash;&ndash;of
concern and helpless sympathy for the woes of
folk. &#8217;Twas set with a child&#8217;s eyes: of the unfaded
blue, inquiring, unafraid, innocent, pathetic, reflecting
the emotion of the moment; quick, too, but in no way
to shame him, to fill with tears. He spoke in a colorless
drawl, with small variation of pitch: a soft, low
voice, of clear timbre, with a note of melancholy insistently
sounding, whatever his mood. I watched him
stumble on; and I wondered concerning the love his
mother had for him, who got no other love, but did
not wonder that he kept her close within his heart, for
here was no mystery.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh, Dannie?&#8221; he reminded me, with a timid little
smile, in which was yet some glint of vanity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, ay!&#8221; I answered; &#8220;you&#8217;re fair on looks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; said he, in fine simplicity; &#8220;mother used t&#8217;
say so, too. She &#8217;lowed,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;that I was
a sight stronger on looks &#8217;n any fool she ever knowed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
It might have been on&#8217;y mother, but maybe not. The
lads, Dannie, out there on the grounds, is wonderful
fond o&#8217; jokin&#8217;, an&#8217; <i>they</i> says I&#8217;ve a power o&#8217; looks; but
mother,&#8221; he concluded, his voice grown caressive and
reverent, &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t lie.&#8221;</p>
<p>It gave me a familiar pang&ndash;&ndash;ay, it <i>hurt</i> me sore&ndash;&ndash;to
feel this loving confidence vibrate upon the strings
within me, and to know that the echo in my heart was
but an echo, after all, distant and blurred, of the
reality of love which was this fool&#8217;s possession.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; she said that?&#8221; I asked, in poignant envy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, ay!&#8221; he answered. &#8220;Afore she knowed I was
a fool, lad, she &#8217;lowed she had the best kid t&#8217; Twist
Tickle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; after?&#8221; I demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;It didn&#8217;t seem t&#8217; make no difference, Dannie, not
a jot.&#8221;</p>
<p>I wisht I had a mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wisht, Dannie,&#8221; said he, in a break of feeling for
me, &#8220;that <i>you</i> had a mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wisht I had,&#8221; said I.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wisht,&#8221; said he, in the way of all men with mothers,
as God knows why, &#8220;that you had one&ndash;&ndash;just like mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>We were come to the turn in the road, where the path
descended at haphazard, over the rocks and past the
pigpen, to the cottage of Eli Flack, builded snugly in
a lee from the easterly gales. For a moment, in the
pause, the fool of Twist Tickle let his hand rest upon
my shoulder, which never before had happened in all
our intercourse, but withdrew it, as though awakened
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
from this pitying affection to a sense of his presumption,
which never, God witness! did I teach him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tis a grand sunset,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Look, Dannie;
&#8217;tis a sunset with gates!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas so: great black gates of cloud, edged with
glowing color, with the quiet and light of harbor
beyond.</p>
<p>&#8220;With gates!&#8221; he whispered.</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas the fancy of a fool; nay, &#8217;twas the fancy (as
chanced his need) of some strange wisdom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dannie,&#8221; said he, &#8220;they&#8217;s times when I sees
mother&#8217;s face peerin&#8217; at me from them clouds&ndash;&ndash;her
own dear face as &#8217;twas afore she died. She&#8217;s keepin&#8217;
watch from the windows o&#8217; heaven&ndash;&ndash;keepin&#8217; watch,
jus&#8217; like she used t&#8217; do. You&#8217;ll never tell, will you,
lad? You&#8217;ll not shame me, will you? They&#8217;d laugh,
out there on the grounds, an you told: for they&#8217;re so
wonderful fond o&#8217; laughter&ndash;&ndash;out there on the grounds.
I lives, somehow,&#8221; said he, brushing his hand in bewilderment
over his eyes, &#8220;in the midst o&#8217; laughter,
but have no call t&#8217; laugh. I wonder why, for mother
didn&#8217;t laugh; an&#8217; I wonder why <i>they</i> laughs so much.
They&#8217;d laugh, Dannie, an you told un she was keepin&#8217;
watch; an&#8217; so you will not: for I&#8217;ve growed, somehow,
wonderful tired o&#8217; laughter&ndash;&ndash;since mother died. But
&#8217;tis so: I knows &#8217;tis so! I sees her face in the light o&#8217;
sunsets&ndash;&ndash;just as it used t&#8217; be. She comes t&#8217; the gate,
when the black clouds arise t&#8217; hide the mystery we&#8217;ve
no call t&#8217; know, an&#8217; the dear Lord cares not what we
fathom; an&#8217; I sees her, Dannie, from my punt, still
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
keepin&#8217; watch upon me, just like she done from the
window, afore she went an&#8217; died. She was a wonderful
hand, somehow, at keepin&#8217; watch at the window.
She&#8217;d watch me go an&#8217; watch me come. I&#8217;ve often
wondered why she done it. I&#8217;ve wondered, Dannie,
an&#8217; wondered, but never could tell why. Why, Dannie,
I&#8217;ve knowed her t&#8217; run out, by times, an&#8217; say: &#8216;Come,
dear, &#8217;tis time you was within. Hush, lad, never care.
They&#8217;ll never hurt you, dear,&#8217; says she, &#8216;when you&#8217;re
within&ndash;&ndash;with me.&#8217; An&#8217;, Dannie, t&#8217; this day I&#8217;m feared
t&#8217; look into the sky, at evening, when I&#8217;ve been bad,
lest I sees her saddened by my deeds; but when I&#8217;m
good, I&#8217;m glad t&#8217; see her face, for she smiles, lad, just
like she used t&#8217; do from the window&ndash;&ndash;afore they buried
her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; said I; &#8220;I&#8217;ve no doubt, Moses&ndash;&ndash;nar a doubt
at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>The wind had risen; &#8217;twas blowing from south by
sou&#8217;east in meaning gusts: gusts intent upon riot, without
compassion, loosed and conscious of release to work
the will they had. The wind cares nothing for the
needs of men; it has no other feeling than to vent its
strength upon the strength of us&ndash;&ndash;the lust (it seems to
me) for a trial of passion, not knowing the enlistment
of our hearts. &#8217;Tis by the heart alone that we outlive
the sea&#8217;s angry, crafty hate, for which there is no cause,
since we would live at peace with it: for the heart
remembers the kitchens of our land, and, defiant or
not, evades the trial, repressed by love, as the sea
knows no repression. &#8217;Twas blowing smartly, with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
the promise of greater strength&ndash;&ndash;&#8217;twas a time for reefs;
&#8217;twas a time for cautious folk, who loved their young,
to walk warily upon the waters lest they be undone.
The wind is a taunter; and the sea perversely incites in
some folk&ndash;&ndash;though &#8217;tis hardly credible to such as follow
her by day and night&ndash;&ndash;strange desire to flaunt abroad,
despite the bitter regard in which she holds the sons of
men. I was glad that the folk of our harbor were
within the tickle: for the sea of Ship&#8217;s Run, now turned
black, was baring its white teeth. &#8217;Twas an unkind
place to be caught in a gale of wind; but our folk were
wise&ndash;&ndash;knowing in the wiles of the sea&ndash;&ndash;and were not
to be trapped in the danger fools despise.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m on&#8217;y a fool,&#8221; said Moses Shoos; &#8220;but, Dannie,
mother &#8217;lowed, afore she died, that I was wonderful
good t&#8217; she. &#8216;Moses, lad,&#8217; says mother, on that day,
&#8216;fool or no fool, looks or not, you been wonderful good
t&#8217; me. I could never love you more; an&#8217; I wouldn&#8217;t
trade you, lad, for the brightest man o&#8217; Twist Tickle.
Does you hear me, dear?&#8217; says she. &#8216;I wants you t&#8217;
remember. I loves you,&#8217; says she; &#8216;an&#8217; fool or no fool,
I&#8217;d never trade you off, you&#8217;ve been so good t&#8217; me.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;T&#8217; be sure not!&#8221; cries I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not mother,&#8221; said he; &#8220;not&ndash;&ndash;<i>my</i> mother!&#8221;</p>
<p>I reminded him that &#8217;twas time to be about his courtship,
for the light was fading now, and &#8217;twould soon
be dark.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; said he; &#8220;mother &#8217;lowed &#8217;twasn&#8217;t good for
man t&#8217; be alone. An&#8217; I &#8217;low she knowed.&#8221;</p>
<p>I watched him down the hill....</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span></div>
<p>I was but a motherless lad&ndash;&ndash;not yet grown wise,
but old enough, indeed, to want a mother&ndash;&ndash;in some
dim way (which even yet is not clear to my heart&#8217;s
ignorance, nor ever will be, since I am born as I am)
sensitive to feel the fathomless, boundless lack, poignantly
conscious that my poor vision, at its clearest,
was but a flash of insight. I used to try, I know, as a
child, lying alone in the dark, when my uncle was gone
to bed, to conjure from the shadows some yearning
face, to feel a soft hand come gratefully from the hidden
places of my room to smooth the couch and touch
me with a healing touch, in cure of my uneasy tossing,
to hear a voice crooning to my woe and restlessness;
but never, ache and wish as I would, did there come
from the dark a face, a hand, a voice which was my
mother&#8217;s; nay, I must lie alone, a child forsaken in the
night, wanting that brooding presence, in pain for which
there was no ease at all in all the world. I watched the
fool of Twist Tickle go gravely in at the kitchen door,
upon his business, led by the memory of a wisdom
greater than his own, beneficent, continuing, but not
known to me, who was no fool; and I envied him&ndash;&ndash;spite
of his burden of folly&ndash;&ndash;his legacy of love. &#8217;Twas
fallen into dusk: the hills were turning shapeless in
the night, the glow all fled from the sky, the sea gone
black. But still I waited&ndash;&ndash;apart from the rock and
shadows and great waters of the world God made&ndash;&ndash;a
child yearning for the face and hand and tender guidance
of the woman who was his own, but yet had
wandered away into the shades from which no need
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
could summon her. It seemed to me, then, that the
mothers who died, leaving sons, were unhappy in their
death, nor ever could be content in their new state. I
wanted mine&ndash;&ndash;I wanted her!&ndash;&ndash;wanted her as only a
child can crave, but could not have her&ndash;&ndash;not though I
sorely wanted her....</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>He came at last&ndash;&ndash;and came in habitual dignity&ndash;&ndash;punctiliously
closing the door behind him and continuing
on with grave steps.</p>
<p>&#8220;You here, Dannie?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, Moses; still waitin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis kind, lad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I &#8217;lowed I&#8217;d wait, Moses,&#8221; I ventured, &#8220;t&#8217; find
out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis grown thick,&#8221; said he. &#8220;&#8217;Twill blow from
the east with fog an&#8217; rain. You&#8217;re bound home,
Dannie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; said I; &#8220;&#8217;tis far past tea-time.&#8221;</p>
<p>We got under way.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twill blow an uncivil sort o&#8217; gale from the east,&#8221;
he remarked, in a casual way. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have Sunk
Rock breakin&#8217; the morrow. &#8217;Twill not be fit for
fishin&#8217; on the Off-an&#8217;-On grounds. But I &#8217;low I&#8217;ll go
out, anyhow. Nothin&#8217; like a spurt o&#8217; labor,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;t&#8217; distract the mind. Mother always said so; an&#8217;
she knowed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The maid would not have you, Moses?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother always &#8217;lowed,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;that &#8217;twas
wise t&#8217; distract the mind in case o&#8217; disappointment.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
I &#8217;low I&#8217;ll overhaul the splittin&#8217;-table when I gets t&#8217;
home. She needs a scrubbin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>We came to the rise in the road.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; said he, &#8220;&#8217;lowed that if ever I come in
from Whisper Cove t&#8217; build at Twist Tickle, she&#8217;d
have the house sot here. I &#8217;low I&#8217;ll put one up, some
time, t&#8217; have it ready ag&#8217;in&#8217; the time I&#8217;m married.
Mother &#8217;lowed &#8217;twas a good thing t&#8217; be forehanded
with they little things.&#8221; The note of melancholy, always
present, but often subdued, so that it sounded
below the music of his voice, was now obtrusive: a
monotonous repetition, compelling attention, insistent,
an unvarying note of sadness. &#8220;Ay,&#8221; he continued;
&#8220;mother &#8217;lowed &#8217;twas a good thing t&#8217; have a view.
She&#8217;d have it sot here, says she, facin&#8217; the west, if ever
I got enough ahead with the fish t&#8217; think o&#8217; buildin&#8217;.
She&#8217;d have it sot, says she, so she could watch the
sunset an&#8217; keep a eye on the tickle t&#8217; see my punt
come in. She was wonderful on sunsets, was mother;
an&#8217; she was sort o&#8217; sot, somehow, on keepin&#8217; watch on
me. Wonderful good o&#8217; she, wasn&#8217;t it, Dannie, t&#8217; want
t&#8217; keep watch&ndash;&ndash;on me?&#8221; Again the note of melancholy,
throbbing above the drawl&ndash;&ndash;rising, indeed, into
a wail. &#8220;So,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I &#8217;low I&#8217;ll just put up a house,
by-an&#8217;-by, for the wife I&#8217;m t&#8217; have; an&#8217; I&#8217;ll have it here,
I&#8217;m thinkin&#8217;, for mother &#8217;lowed my wife would want
it with a view o&#8217; the tickle, t&#8217; watch my punt come in.
Think she will, Dannie? Think she will?&#8221;</p>
<p>The mail-boat blew in the narrows.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must haste!&#8221; said I.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span></div>
<p>&#8220;An you must haste, Dannie,&#8221; said he, &#8220;run on.
I&#8217;ll not make haste, for I&#8217;m &#8217;lowin&#8217; that a little spell o&#8217;
thinkin&#8217; about mother will sort o&#8217; do me good.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>I ran on, fast as my legs would carry me (which was
not very fast). &#8217;Twas the departing whistle; the mail-boat
had come and gone&ndash;&ndash;I saw her lights, shining
warmly in the dark, grow small as she fared out through
the narrows to the sea. It began to rain in great drops;
overhead &#8217;twas all black&ndash;&ndash;roundabout a world of looming
shadows, having lights, like stars, where the cottages
were set on the hills. I made haste on my way;
and as I pattered on over the uneven road to the neck
of land by the Lost Soul, I blamed myself right heartily,
regretting my uncle&#8217;s disappointment, in that the expected
guest would already have arrived, landed by
way of my uncle&#8217;s punt. And, indeed, the man was
there, as I learned: for my uncle met me on the gravelled
path of our garden, to bid me, but not with ill-temper,
begone up-stairs and into clean linen and
fitting garments, which were laid out and waiting (he
said) on my bed. And when, descending in clean and
proper array, bejewelled to suit the occasion, by my
uncle&#8217;s command, I came to the best room, I found
there a young man in black, scarce older, it seemed,
than myself.</p>
<p>&#8220;This here young man, Dannie,&#8221; says my uncle,
with a flourish, &#8220;is your tutor.&#8221;</p>
<p>I bowed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Imported direck,&#8221; adds my uncle, &#8220;from Lon&#8217;on.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span></div>
<p>My tooter? It sounded musical: I wondered what
the young man blew&ndash;&ndash;but shook hands, in the Chesterfieldian
manner (as best I had mastered it), and expressed
myself (in such Chesterfieldian language as I
could recall in that emergency) as being delighted to
form an acquaintance so distinguished.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well done!&#8221; cries my uncle, past containing his
pride in the Chesterfieldian achievement. &#8220;Sir Harry
hisself couldn&#8217;t beat it!&#8221;</p>
<p>The young man laughed pleasantly.</p>

<h2>X</h2>
<h3>IMPORTED DIRECT</h3>
</div>
<p>I laughed, too, unable to help it, and my uncle
guffawed, in his large way; and then we all laughed
like tried friends together: so that &#8217;twas plain, being
thus at once set upon agreeable terms, with no shyness
or threat of antipathy to give ill ease, that we three
strange folk were well-met in the wide world. &#8217;Twas
cosey in the best room: a lively blaze in the fireplace,
the room bright with lamplight, warm with the color
of carpet and tapestried mahogany, spotless and grand,
as I thought, in every part; ay, cosey enough, with
good company well-met within, the risen wind clamoring
through the night, the rain lashing the black panes,
the sea rumbling upon the rocks below, and, withal,
a savory smell abroad in goodly promise. My uncle,
grown fat as a gnome in these days, grotesquely fashioned,
miscellaneously clothed as ever, stood with legs
wide upon the black wolf&#8217;s-skin, his back to the fire,
his great hands clasped over his paunch, lying as upon
a shelf; regarding the direct importation and myself,
the rise of my admiration, the room, the whole world,
indeed, visible and invisible, with delight so boyish
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
that &#8217;twas good to watch the play of satisfaction upon
his fantastic countenance, which now rippled and
twinkled from his black cravat to his topmost scars
and bristles. Well-met were we three folk; ay, no
doubt: I was in a glow of content with this new fortune.</p>
<p>&#8217;Tis strange how the affections fall....</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>My tutor, John Cather, as his name turned out to
be, was older than I, after all&ndash;&ndash;my elder by five years,
I fancied, with age-wise ways and a proud glance to
overawe my youth, were need of it to come: a slight,
dark-skinned man, clean-featured, lean-cheeked, full-lipped,
with restless dark eyes, thin, olive-tinted hands,
black hair, worn overlong, parted in the manner of a
maid and falling upon his brow in glossy waves, which
he would ruffle into disorder, with the air of knowing
what he was about. He was clad all in black, for the
reason, he said, that he aspired to holy orders: well-kept
black, edged with linen of the whitest, and not
ill cut, according to my uncle&#8217;s fashion-plates, but
sadly worn at the seams and everywhere brushed near
threadbare. Now sprawled, hands pocketed, in a great-chair
under the lamp, indolent with accomplished grace
(it seemed), one long leg thrown languidly over the
other, the slender foot never at rest, he was postured
with that perfection of ease and gentility into which my
uncle, watchful observer of the manners of the world
he walked in, had many a time endeavored to command
me, but with the most indifferent success. I listened
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
to my tutor&#8217;s airy, rambling chit-chat of the day&#8217;s adventures,
captivated by the readiness and wit and
genial outlook; the manner of it being new to my experience,
the accompaniment of easy laughter a grateful
enlightenment in a land where folk went soberly. And
then and there&ndash;&ndash;I remember, as &#8217;twere an hour gone,
the gale and the lamplight and the laughter of that
time&ndash;&ndash;I conceived for him an enduring admiration.</p>
<p>Taken by an anxious thought I whispered in my
uncle&#8217;s ear, having him bend his monstrous head close
for secrecy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221; says he.</p>
<p>I repeated the question.</p>
<p>&#8220;Steerage, lad,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;Tut!&#8221; he growled,
&#8220;none o&#8217; that, now! &#8217;Twill be steerage.&#8221;</p>
<p>It grieved me to know it.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; now, Dannie, lad,&#8221; quoth my uncle, aloud,
with a thirsty rubbing of the hands and a grin to match,
&#8220;fetch the bottle. The bottle, b&#8217;y! &#8217;Tis time for
growed men t&#8217; pledge the v&#8217;y&#8217;ge. A bit nippy, parson
man? The bottle, Dannie!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bottle?&#8221; cries my tutor. &#8220;Why, really, you know,
Skipper Nicholas, I&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is you much give t&#8217; the use o&#8217; fo&#8217;c&#8217;s&#8217;les, parson?&#8221;
my uncle interrupted.</p>
<p>My tutor was not.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; says my uncle, grimly, &#8220;you&#8217;ll be wantin&#8217;
a drap.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas true enough, by my uncle&#8217;s mysterious perversity:
a drop would be wanted, indeed.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Dannie, lad,&#8221; he commanded, &#8220;fetch that there
bottle!&#8221;</p>
<p>Cather tossed his head, with a brief little laugh, and
then, resigned to my uncle&#8217;s idiosyncrasy&ndash;&ndash;divining the
importance of it&ndash;&ndash;gave me a quick nod of permission:
the which I was glad to get, aware, as I was, of the
hospitable meaning of my uncle&#8217;s invitation and his
sensitiveness in respect to its reception. So I got the
ill-seeming black bottle from the locker, the tray and
glasses and little brown jug from the pantry, the napkin
from Agatha, in a flutter in the kitchen, and having
returned to the best room, where the tutor awaited
the event in some apparent trepidation, I poured my
uncle&#8217;s dram, and measured an hospitable glass for
Cather, but with less generous hand, not knowing his
capacity, but shrewdly suspecting its inferiority. The
glasses glittered invitingly in the light of the fire and
lamp, and the red liquor lay glowing within: an attractive
draught, no doubt&ndash;&ndash;to warm, upon that windy
night, and to appetize for the belated meat.</p>
<p>&#8220;T&#8217; you, parson!&#8221; says my uncle.</p>
<p>I touched the tutor&#8217;s elbow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Water?&#8221; says he, in doubt. &#8220;Is it the custom?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Leave un be, Dannie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever the custom,&#8221; my tutor began, &#8220;of
course&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis wise,&#8221; I ventured; minded to this by the
man&#8217;s awkward handling of the glass.</p>
<p>&#8220;For shame, Dannie!&#8221; cries my uncle. &#8220;Leave the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
parson take his liquor as he will. &#8217;Tis easy t&#8217; see he
likes it neat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cather was amused.</p>
<p>&#8220;T&#8217; you, parson!&#8221; says my uncle.</p>
<p>The tutor laughed as he raised the glass of clear
rum. I watched him with misgiving, alive to all the
signs of raw procedure&ndash;&ndash;the crook of his elbow, the
tilt of the glass, the lift of his head. &#8220;To you, sir!&#8221;
said he: and resolutely downed it. &#8217;Twas impressive
then, I recall, to observe his face&ndash;&ndash;the spasm of shock
and surprise, the touch of incredulity, of reproachful
complaint, as that hard liquor coursed into his belly.
&#8217;Twas over in a moment&ndash;&ndash;the wry mouth of it, the
shudder&ndash;&ndash;&#8217;twas all over in a flash. My tutor commanded
his features, as rarely a man may, into stoical
disregard of his internal sensations, and stood rigid,
but calm, gripping the back of his chair, his teeth set,
his lips congealed in an unmeaning grin, his eyes,
which ran water against his will, fixed in mild reproach
upon my beaming uncle, turning but once, I
recall, to my solicitous self. With no unseemly outbreak&ndash;&ndash;with
but an inconsequent ahem and a flirt of
his handkerchief over his lips&ndash;&ndash;he returned to his composure.
He would never again drink rum with my
uncle, nor any other liquor, through all the years of our
intimate connection; but this mattered not at all, since
he had in the beginning pledged the old man&#8217;s health
with honor to himself. I was glad, however, that on
the windy night of our meeting he was no more
put out; for I wished him safe within my uncle&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
regard, and knew, as I knew my uncle and the standards
of our land, that he had by this gallant conduct
achieved the exalted station. &#8217;Twas a test of adaptability
(as my uncle held), and of manhood, too, of
which, as a tenet, taught me by that primitive philosopher,
I am not able, bred as I am, to rid myself to this
very day.</p>
<p>&#8220;Parson,&#8221; said my uncle, solemnly, advancing upon
the tutor, &#8220;ye <i>done</i> it, and ye done it <i>well</i>! Shake, shipmate&ndash;&ndash;shake!&#8221;</p>
<p>The bell tinkled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that dinner?&#8221; cries my tutor. &#8220;Jove! but I <i>am</i>
on edge.&#8221;</p>
<p>We moved into the dining-room, myself pitying the
man in a heartfelt way for his stomach&#8217;s sake. &#8217;Twas
unkind in my uncle to sharpen his appetite with red
rum.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>My uncle stumped ahead, his wooden leg as blithe
as the sound one, and was waiting in his humble quarters,
with a gnome-like leer of expectation, when we
entered. Neither my watch, set with its shy jewels,
nor my sparkling fingers, nor the cut and quality and
fit of my London-made clothes, which came close to
perfection, nor anything concerning me, had caused
my tutor even so much as to lift an eyebrow of surprise;
but the appearance of the table, laid in the usual way,
gave him an indubitable fit of amazement: for, as was
our custom on the neck of land by the Lost Soul, at
the one end, where sat the luxurious Dannie Callaway,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
by no will of his own, was the glitter of silver, the flash
and glow of delicate china, a flower or more from our
garden, exquisite napery, the bounties of the kindly
earth, whatever the cost; but at the other (the napery
abruptly ceasing at the centre of the table because of
the wear and tear that might chance) was set out, upon
coarse ware, even to tin, fare of common description,
forecastle fare, fisherman fare, unrelieved by any grace
of flower or linen or glitter of glass, by any grace at
all, save the grace of a black bottle, which, according
to my experience, was sufficient to my uncle and such
rough folk as dined with him. &#8217;Twas no cause for
surprise to me, to whom the enigma had been familiar
from the beginning; but my tutor, come suddenly
against the puzzle, was nonplussed, small blame to
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Parson,&#8221; says my uncle, &#8220;<i>you</i>&ndash;&ndash;goes steerage!&#8221;</p>
<p>My tutor started, regarded my uncle with a little jerk
of astonishment; and his eyebrows went high&ndash;&ndash;but
still conveyed no more than polite inquiry. &#8220;I beg
your pardon?&#8221; he apologized.</p>
<p>&#8220;Steerage, parson!&#8221; my uncle repeated. &#8220;Steerage
passage, sir, the night!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Really!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis the same as sayin&#8217;,&#8221; I made haste to explain,
&#8220;that you dines along o&#8217; Uncle Nick at <i>his</i> end.&#8221;</p>
<p>The tutor was faintly amused.</p>
<p>&#8220;Steerage the night, parson; cabin the morrow,&#8221;
said my uncle. &#8220;Ye&#8217;ll live high, lad, when ye&#8217;re put
in the cabin. Lord love ye, parson! but the feedin&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
there is fair scandalous. &#8217;Twould never do t&#8217; have the
news of it go abroad. An&#8217; as for the liquor! why,
parson,&#8221; he proceeded, tapping my tutor on the breast,
to impress the amazing disclosure, while we stood
awkwardly, &#8220;Dannie haves a locker o&#8217; wine as old as
your grandmother, in this here very room, waitin&#8217; for
un t&#8217; grow up; an&#8217; he&#8217;ll broach it, parson, like a gentleman&ndash;&ndash;he&#8217;ll
broach it for you, when you&#8217;re moved
aft. But bein&#8217; shipped from the morrow, accordin&#8217; t&#8217;
articles, signed, sealed, an&#8217; delivered,&#8221; he added, gravely,
&#8220;&#8217;twouldn&#8217;t be just quite right, accordin&#8217; t&#8217; the lay
o&#8217; fac&#8217;s you&#8217;re not in the way o&#8217; knowin&#8217;, t&#8217; have ye
feed along o&#8217; Dannie the night. &#8217;Twouldn&#8217;t be right,
&#8217;twouldn&#8217;t be honest, as I sees it in the light o&#8217; them
fac&#8217;s; <i>not</i>,&#8221; he repeated, in a whisper, ghostly with the
awe and mystery of it, so that the tutor stared alarmed,
&#8220;accordin&#8217; t&#8217; them damned remarkable fac&#8217;s, as I <i>sees</i>
un! But I&#8217;ve took ye in, parson&ndash;&ndash;<i>I&#8217;ve</i> took ye in!&#8221; he
cried, with a beaming welcome, to which my tutor
instantly responded. &#8220;Ye&#8217;ll find it snug an&#8217; plenty in
the steerage, an&#8217; no questions asked. No questions,&#8221;
he repeated, with a wink of obscure meaning, &#8220;asked.
They&#8217;s junk an&#8217; cabbage, lad, with plum-duff t&#8217; top off
with, for a bit of a treat, an&#8217; rum&ndash;&ndash;why parson! as for
the rum, &#8217;tis as free as water! Sit ye,&#8221; says he, &#8220;an&#8217;
fall to!&#8221; his face all broken into smiles. &#8220;Fall to, parson,
an&#8217; spare nothin&#8217;. Better the salt-junk o&#8217; toil,&#8221;
he improvised, in bold imitation of the Scripture, to
my tutor&#8217;s further astonishment, &#8220;than the ice-cream
o&#8217; crime!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span></div>
<p>My tutor helplessly nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ol&#8217; Nick Top,&#8221; says my uncle, &#8220;is on&#8217;y a hook-an&#8217;-line
man, an&#8217; fares hard, as fishermen must; but
little ol&#8217; Dannie Callaway, sittin&#8217; there in that little
cabin o&#8217; his, is a damn little gentleman, sir, an&#8217; feeds
off the best, as them big-bugs will.&#8221;</p>
<p>We fell to.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wild night,&#8221; my tutor remarked.</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas blowing wildly, indeed: the wind come to the
east&ndash;&ndash;sweeping in from the vast gray sea, with black
rain to fling at the world. The windows rattled as the
gusts went crying past the cottage. But a warm glow,
falling from the lamp above the table, and the fire,
crackling and snorting in the grate, put the power of
the gale to shame. &#8217;Twas cosey where we sat: warm,
light, dry, with hunger driven off&ndash;&ndash;a cosey place on a
bitter night: a peace and comfort to thank the good
God for, with many a schooner off our coast, from
Chidley to the Baccalieu light, riding out the gale, in
a smother of broken water, with a rocky shore and a
flash of breakers to leeward. Born as I am&ndash;&ndash;Newfoundlander
to the marrow of my body and the innermost
parts of my soul&ndash;&ndash;my heart puts to sea, unfailingly,
whatever the ease and security of my place,
when the wind blows high in the night and the great
sea rages. &#8217;Tis a fine heritage we have, we outport
Newfoundlanders&ndash;&ndash;this feeling for the toss and tumult
and dripping cold of the sea: this sympathy, born of
self-same experience. I&#8217;d not exchange it, with the
riches of cities to boot, for the thin-lipped, gray, cold-eyed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
astuteness, the pomp and splendid masks, of the
marts and avenues I have seen in my time. I&#8217;d be
a Newfoundlander, outport born, outport bred, of
outport strength and tenderness of heart, of outport
sincerity, had I my birth to choose....</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&#8220;Dannie,&#8221; says my uncle, peering inquisitively into
the cabin, &#8220;how d&#8217;ye like that there fresh beef?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas good.</p>
<p>&#8220;He likes it!&#8221; cries my uncle, delighted. &#8220;Parson,
he likes it. Hear un? He likes it. An&#8217; &#8217;tis paid for,
parson&ndash;&ndash;paid for! Dannie,&#8221; says he, again leaning
forward, eyes bent upon my plates, &#8220;how d&#8217;ye like them
there fresh greens? Eh, lad?&#8221;</p>
<p>They were very good.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; paid for, parson&ndash;&ndash;all paid for!&#8221;</p>
<p>My tutor, poor man! stared agape, his knife and
fork laid by; for my uncle, become now excited and
most indiscreet, was in a manner the most perplexing&ndash;&ndash;and
in some mysterious indication&ndash;&ndash;pointing, thumb
down, towards the oil-cloth that floored the room, or
to the rocks beneath, which the wind ran over, the
house being set on spiles, or to the bowels of the earth,
as you may choose. &#8217;Twas a familiar thing to me&ndash;&ndash;the
mystery of the turned thumb and spasmodic indication,
the appearance, too, at such times, of my uncle&#8217;s
eyes: round, protruding, alight with wicked admiration,
starting from the scars and bristles and disfigurements
of his face, but yet reflecting awe, as of some
unholy daring, to be mightily suffered for in due time.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
But &#8217;twas not familiar to my tutor, nor, doubtless, had
ever occurred to his imagination, sophisticated as he
may have thought it; he could do nothing but withstand
the amazement as best he might, and that in
a mean, poor way, as he gazed alternately upon my
uncle&#8217;s flushed and deeply stirred countenance and upon
my own saddened, aged face, speaking its ancient bewilderment.
I pitied his disquietude, rather: for he
was come from abroad to our coast&ndash;&ndash;and could not
understand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dannie, lad,&#8221; my uncle anxiously inquired, &#8220;<i>can</i> it
be that you likes them there fresh carrots?&#8221;</p>
<p>It could easily be.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; paid for!&#8221; my uncle ejaculated, with no abatement
of delight. &#8220;Parson,&#8221; he proceeded, proudly,
&#8220;good feed that there young gentleman has in the
cabin, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>My tutor agreed.</p>
<p>&#8220;None better in the world, eh?&#8221; the old man went
on. &#8220;<i>You</i> couldn&#8217;t do no better, could you?&#8221;</p>
<p>My tutor said that no man could.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; paid for,&#8221; says my uncle, thumbing down.
&#8220;Paid for, every bite!&#8221; He turned to me. &#8220;Dannie,&#8221;
says he, &#8220;how d&#8217;ye like them there new potatoes?&#8221;</p>
<p>They were more than palatable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hear that, parson!&#8221; cries my uncle. &#8220;He likes un!
Imported direck, sir, from Bermuda,&#8221; says he, with all
the vanity of riches. &#8220;Ever feed so high yourself, parson?
Consignment arrived,&#8221; says he, &#8220;per S.S. <i>Silvia</i>.
You&#8217;ll see it in the <i>Herald</i> an you looks.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Really!&#8221; my tutor exclaimed, for lack of something
better.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fac&#8217;,&#8221; says my uncle; &#8220;an&#8217; paid for&ndash;&ndash;skin an&#8217;
eye!&#8221;</p>
<p>My tutor gave it up&ndash;&ndash;permitted himself no longer to
be troublesomely mystified; but after a quick glance
from steerage to cabin, flashed with amused comprehension
of the contrast, threw back his head with a
little laugh quite detached from our concerns, and presently,
innured to the grotesquery, busied himself with
relish upon his salt-junk. Thereafter, the rum buzzing
in his head, he ran on in a vivacious way upon all things
under the sun, save himself, so that the windy night
seemed very far away, indeed, and the lamplight and
fire to lend an inspiration to his nimble tongue, until,
in a lull of the engaging discourse, he caught my uncle
peering greedily into the cabin, all but licking his lips,
his nostrils distended to the savor, his flooded eyes
fixed upon the fresh beef and vegetables in manifest
longing, every wrinkle and muscle of his broad face off
guard. My tutor&ndash;&ndash;somewhat affected, I fancy, by this
display&ndash;&ndash;turned to me with a little frown of curiosity,
an intrusive regard, it seemed to me, which I might in
all courtesy fend off for the future. &#8217;Twas now time,
thinks I, to enlighten him with the knowledge I had:
a task I had no liking for, since in its accomplishment
I must stir my uncle unduly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Nick,&#8221; says I, &#8220;&#8217;tis like Mr. Cather will be
havin&#8217; a cut off my roast.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The parson?&#8221; my uncle demanded.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; says I, disregarding his scowl; &#8220;a bit o&#8217; roast
beef.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not he!&#8221; snaps my uncle. &#8220;Not a bite!&#8221;</p>
<p>I nerved myself&ndash;&ndash;with a view wholly to Cather&#8217;s information.
&#8220;Uncle Nick,&#8221; I proceeded, my heart
thumping, such was the temerity of the thing, &#8220;&#8217;tis a
dirty night without, an&#8217; here&#8217;s Mr. Cather just joined
the ship, an&#8217; I &#8217;low, now, the night, Uncle Nick, that
maybe you&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Me?&#8221; roars my uncle, in a flare of rage and horror.
&#8220;<i>Me</i> touch it? ME!&#8221;</p>
<p>The vehemence of this amazed my tutor, who could
supply no cause for the outburst; but &#8217;twas no more
than I had expected in the beginning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Me!&#8221; my uncle gasped.</p>
<p>There was a knock at the door....</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Ay, a knock at the door! &#8217;Twas a thing most unexpected.
That there should come a knock at the
door! &#8217;Twas past believing. &#8217;Twas no timid tapping;
&#8217;twas a clamor&ndash;&ndash;without humility or politeness. Who
should knock? There had been no outcry; &#8217;twas then
no wreck or sudden peril of our people. Again it rang
loud and authoritative&ndash;&ndash;as though one came by right
of law or in vindictive anger. My uncle, shocked all at
once out of a wide-eyed daze of astonishment, pushed
back from the board, in a terrified flurry, his face purpled
and swollen, and blundered about for his staff;
but before he had got to his feet, our maid-servant, on
a fluttering run from the kitchen, was come to the door.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
The gale broke in&ndash;&ndash;rushing noises and a swirl of wet
wind. We listened; there was a voice, not the maid-servant&#8217;s&ndash;&ndash;thin,
high-tempered, lifted in irascible demand&ndash;&ndash;but
never a word to be distinguished in that obscurity
of wind and rain. &#8217;Twas cold, and the lamp was
flaring: I closed the door against this inrush of weather.</p>
<p>My wretched uncle beckoned the tutor close, a finger
lifted in caution; but still kept looking at me&ndash;&ndash;and all
the while stared at me with eyes of frightened width&ndash;&ndash;in
a way that saw me not at all. &#8220;Parson,&#8221; he whispered,
&#8220;they wasn&#8217;t ar another man landed by the
mail-boat the day, was they?&#8221;</p>
<p>The tutor nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye wouldn&#8217;t say, would ye,&#8221; my uncle diffidently
inquired, &#8220;that he&#8217;d be from St. John&#8217;s by the cut of
um?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A gray little man from St. John&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I &#8217;low then,&#8221; says my uncle, &#8220;that he talked a wonderful
spell about a lad, didn&#8217;t um?&#8221;</p>
<p>My tutor shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nar a word&ndash;&ndash;about <i>any</i> lad?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure not.&#8221;</p>
<p>My uncle tapped the tip of his nose.</p>
<p>&#8220;A red mole,&#8221; said my tutor.</p>
<p>And now my uncle poured himself a great dram of
rum. &#8217;Twas a cataract of liquor! Never such a
draught had I known him dare&ndash;&ndash;not in his most abandoned
hours at the Anchor and Chain. &#8217;Twas beyond
him to down it at a gulp; &#8217;twas in two gulps that he
managed it, but with no breath between&ndash;&ndash;and then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
pushed the glass away with a shudder of disgust. Presently&ndash;&ndash;when
the liquor had restored his courage and
begun to fetch the color to his pallid face&ndash;&ndash;he got his
staff in his fist and stumbled off in a high bluster, muttering
gross imprecations as he went. The door slammed
behind him; we heard no more&ndash;&ndash;never a sound of
growl or laugh from the best room where he sat with
the gray little man from St. John&#8217;s. &#8217;Twas not a great
while he stayed; and when he came again&ndash;&ndash;the stranger
having gone&ndash;&ndash;he drew up to the board with all his good-humor
and ease of mind regained. The rum had thickened
his tongue and given a wilful turn to his wooden
leg: no more. There was not a hint of discomposure
anywhere about him to be descried; and I was glad of
this, for I had supposed, being of an imaginative turn,
that all the mystery of the luxury that was mine was at
last come to its dreadful climax.</p>
<p>&#8220;A ol&#8217; shipmate, Dannie,&#8221; my uncle genially explained.</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas hard to believe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sailed along o&#8217; that there ol&#8217; bully t&#8217; Brazilian
ports,&#8221; says he, &#8220;thirty year ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>I wondered why my uncle had not called for
his bottle to be brought in haste to the best
room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Still storming,&#8221; the tutor ventured.</p>
<p>&#8220;Blowin&#8217; high,&#8221; I remarked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I &#8217;low I&#8217;ll stay ashore, the morrow,&#8221; says my uncle,
&#8220;an&#8217; have a spurt o&#8217; yarnin&#8217; along o&#8217; that there ol&#8217;
bully.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></div>
<p>But the gray little man from St. John&#8217;s&ndash;&ndash;the gray
little red-moled man&ndash;&ndash;was no old shipmate (I knew),
nor any friend at all, else my uncle would have had him
hospitably housed for the night under our roof.</p>

<h2>XI</h2>
<h3>THE GRAY STRANGER</h3>
</div>
<p>We sat late by the fire in the best room: into which
I must fairly lug my perverse old uncle by the
ears&ndash;&ndash;for (says he) the wear an&#8217; tear of a wooden leg
was a harsh thing for a carpet to abide, an&#8217; parlor
chairs (says he) was never made for the hulks o&#8217; sea-farin&#8217;
folk. &#8217;Twas late, indeed, when he sent young
Cather off to bed, with a warning to be up betimes, or
go hungry, and bade me into the dining-room, as was
our custom, to set out his bottle and glass. I turned
the lamp high, and threw birch on the fire, and lifted
his gouty wooden leg to the stool, and got his bottle
and little brown jug, wondering, all the while, that my
uncle was downcast neither by the wind nor the singular
intrusion of the gray stranger. &#8217;Twas a new thing in
my life&ndash;&ndash;a grateful change, for heretofore, in black
gales, blowing in the night, with the thunder of waters
under the window, it had been my duty to stand by,
giving the comfort of my presence to the old man&#8217;s
melancholy and terror. &#8217;Twas the company of the
tutor, thinks I, and I was glad that the congenial
fellow was come from a far place, escape cut off.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Wonderful late,&#8221; says my uncle.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said I; &#8220;not late for windy nights.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Too late for lads,&#8221; says he, uneasily.</p>
<p>I poured his glass of rum.</p>
<p>&#8220;Think you, Dannie,&#8221; my uncle inquired, &#8220;that he&#8217;ve
the makin&#8217;s of a fair rascal?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; who?&#8221; says I, the stranger in mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;The tutor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m hopin&#8217; <i>not</i>!&#8221; I cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; says my uncle, an eye half closed; &#8220;but think
you he <i>would</i> make a rascal&ndash;&ndash;with clever management?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twould never come t&#8217; pass, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>My uncle sipped his rum in a muse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Nick,&#8221; I complained, &#8220;leave un be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis a hard world, Dannie,&#8221; he replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you leave un be!&#8221; I expostulated.</p>
<p>My uncle ignored me. &#8220;He&#8217;ve a eye, Dannie,&#8221; says
he, immersed in villanous calculation; &#8220;he&#8217;ve a dark
eye. I &#8217;low it <i>might</i> be managed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas an uncomfortable suspicion thus implanted;
and &#8217;twas an unhappy outlook disclosed&ndash;&ndash;were my
uncle to work his will upon the helpless fellow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Nick, you&#8217;ll not mislead un?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bein&#8217; under oath,&#8221; my uncle answered, with the
accent and glance of tenderest affection, &#8220;I&#8217;ll keep on,
Dannie, t&#8217; the end.&#8221;</p>
<p>I poured the second dram of rum and pushed it
towards him. &#8217;Twas all hopeless to protest or seek
an understanding. I loved the old man, and forgave
the paradox of his rascality and loyal affection. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
young man from London must take his chance, as
must we all, in the fashioning hands of circumstance.
&#8217;Twas not to be conceived that his ruin was here to be
wrought. My uncle&#8217;s face had lost all appearance of
repulsion: scar and color and swollen vein&ndash;&ndash;the last
mark of sin and the sea&ndash;&ndash;had seemed to vanish from
it; &#8217;twas as though the finger of God had in passing
touched it into such beauty as the love of children may
create of the meanest features of our kind. His glass
was in his marred, toil-distorted hand; but his eyes,
grown clear and sparkling and crystal-pure&ndash;&ndash;as high of
purpose as the eyes of such as delight in sacrifice&ndash;&ndash;were
bent upon the lad he had fostered to my age. I dared
not&ndash;&ndash;not the lad that was I&ndash;&ndash;I dared not accuse him!
Let the young man from London, come for the wage he
got, resist, if need were to resist. I could not credit
his danger&ndash;&ndash;not on that night. But I see better now
than then I saw.</p>
<p>&#8220;I &#8217;low he&#8217;ll do,&#8221; said my uncle, presently, as he set
down his glass. &#8220;Ay, lad; he&#8217;ll do, if I knows a eye
from a eye.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yield,&#8221; he answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;T&#8217; what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Temptation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Nick,&#8221; I besought, &#8220;leave the man be!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What odds?&#8221; he answered, the shadow of gloom
come upon his face. &#8220;I&#8217;m cleared for hell, anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas a thing beyond me, as many a word and
wicked deed had been before. I was used to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
wretched puzzle&ndash;&ndash;calloused and uncaring, since through
all my life I still loved the man who fostered me, and
held him in esteem. We fell silent together, as often
happened when my uncle tippled himself drunk at
night; and my mind coursed in free flight past the
seeming peril in which my tutor slept, past the roar of
wind and the clamor of the sea, beyond the woes of the
fool who would be married, to the cabin of the <i>Shining
Light</i>, where Judith sat serene in the midst of the order
she had accomplished. I remembered the sunlight and
the freshening breeze upon the hills, the chirp and gentle
stirring of the day, the azure sea and the far-off,
tender mist, the playful breakers, flinging spray into
the yellow sunshine. I remembered the companionable
presence of the maid, her slender hands, her tawny
hair, her sun-browned cheeks and the creamy curve of
her brow, the blue and flash and fathomless depths of
her eyes. I remembered the sweet, moist touch of her
lips: I remembered&ndash;&ndash;in that period of musing, when
my uncle, fallen disconsolate in his chair, sipped his
rum&ndash;&ndash;the kiss that she gave me in the cabin of the
<i>Shining Light</i>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dannie,&#8221; says my uncle, &#8220;what you thinkin&#8217;
about?&#8221;</p>
<p>I would not tell.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis some good thing,&#8221; says he. &#8220;I&#8217;d like wonderful
well t&#8217; know.&#8221;</p>
<p>I could but sigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dannie,&#8221; says he, in his wisdom, &#8220;you&#8217;ve growed
wonderful fond o&#8217; Judy, isn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m t&#8217; wed Judy,&#8221; I answered.</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas with no unkindness&ndash;&ndash;but with a sly twinkle
of understanding&ndash;&ndash;that he looked upon me.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I grows up,&#8221; I added, for his comfort.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; says he. &#8220;You&#8217;ll never wed Judith. A
gentleman? &#8217;Twould scandalize Chesterfield.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; said I.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll <i>not</i>!&#8221; cries he, in earnest.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I will!&#8221;</p>
<p>The defiance still left him smiling. &#8220;Not accordin&#8217;
t&#8217; Chesterfield,&#8221; says he. &#8220;You&#8217;ll be a gentleman,
Dannie, when you grows up, an&#8217; you&#8217;ll not be wantin&#8217;
t&#8217; wed Judy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not <i>wantin&#8217;</i> to?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no; you&#8217;ll not be wantin&#8217; to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Still,&#8221; says I, &#8220;will I wed Judy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; said I, &#8220;I&#8217;ve kissed her!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>My uncle would have his last glass alone (he said);
and I must be off to bed and to sleep; &#8217;twas grown late
for me (said he) beyond the stretch of his conscience to
endure. Lord love us! (said he) would I never be t&#8217;
bed in season? Off with me&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; t&#8217; sleep with me!
&#8217;Twould be the worse for me (said he) an he caught
me wakeful when he turned in. The thing had an odd
look&ndash;&ndash;an odd look, to be sure&ndash;&ndash;for never before had
the old man&#8217;s conscience pricked him to such fatherly
consideration upon a night when the wind blew high.
I extinguished the hanging lamp, smothered the smouldering
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
coals, set his night-lamp at hand, and drowsily
climbed the stairs, having given him good-night, with a
hearty &#8220;Thank &#8217;e, sir, for that there tutor!&#8221; He bawled
after me an injunction against lying awake; and I
should presently have gone sound asleep, worn with the
excitements of the day, had I not caught ear of him on
the move. &#8217;Twas the wary tap and thump of his staff
and wooden leg that instantly enlisted my attention;
then a cautious fumbling at the latch of the door, a
draught of night air, a thin-voiced, garrulous complaint
of the weather and long waiting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hist, ye fool!&#8221; says my uncle. &#8220;Ye&#8217;ll wake the
lad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn the lad!&#8221; was the prompt response. &#8220;I wish
he were dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>My uncle laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dead!&#8221; the stranger repeated. &#8220;Dead, Top! And
you, too&ndash;&ndash;you hound!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas an anathema spoken in wrath and hatred.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thinkin&#8217;,&#8221; says my uncle, &#8220;that ye&#8217;re an unkind
man.&#8221;</p>
<p>The stranger growled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Save your temper, man,&#8221; my uncle admonished.
&#8220;Ye&#8217;ll need the last rag of it afore the night&#8217;s
by.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man cried out against the threat.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m tellin&#8217; ye,&#8221; says my uncle&ndash;&ndash;and I heard his
broad hand come with a meaning clap on the stranger&#8217;s
shoulder&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;that ye&#8217;ll be wakin&#8217; the lad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The lad! the lad!&#8221; the stranger whined. &#8220;Is there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
nothing in the world for you, Top, but that club-footed
young whelp?&#8221;</p>
<p>I heard it! I heard the words! My door was ajar&ndash;&ndash;my
room at the head of the stair&ndash;&ndash;my ears wide and
anxious. I heard the words! There was no mistaking
what this intruder said. &#8220;The club-footed young
whelp!&#8221; says he. &#8220;Is there nothing in the world for
you, Top, but that club-footed young whelp?&#8221; He
said it&ndash;&ndash;I remember that he said it&ndash;&ndash;and to this day,
when I am grown beyond the years of childish sensitiveness,
I resent the jibe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; my uncle answered. &#8220;Nothing in the
world, sir,&#8221; he repeated, lovingly, as I thought, &#8220;but
only that poor club-footed child!&#8221;</p>
<p>Sir? &#8217;Twas a queer way to address, thinks I, this
man of doubtful quality. Sir? I could not make it
out.</p>
<p>&#8220;You sentimental fool!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nay, sir,&#8221; my uncle rejoined, with spirit. &#8220;An
they&#8217;s a fool in the company, &#8217;tis yourself. I&#8217;ve that
from the lad, sir, that you goes lacking&ndash;&ndash;ay, an&#8217; will
go, t&#8217; the grave!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what, Top,&#8221; the stranger sneered, &#8220;may this
thing be?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye&#8217;ll laugh, sir,&#8221; my uncle replied, &#8220;when I tells
you &#8217;tis his love.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man did laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;For shame!&#8221; cried my uncle.</p>
<p>He was taking off his wraps&ndash;&ndash;this stranger. They
were so many that I wondered. He was a man of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
quality, after all, it might be. &#8220;I tell you, Top,&#8221; said
he, &#8220;that the boy may be damned for all I care. I
said damned. I <i>mean</i> damned. There isn&#8217;t another
form of words, with which I am acquainted, sufficient
to express my lack of interest in this child&#8217;s welfare.
Do you understand me, Top? And do you realize&ndash;&ndash;you
obstinate noddy!&ndash;&ndash;that my heart&#8217;s in the word?
You and I, Top, have business together. It&#8217;s a dirty
business. It was in the beginning; it is now&ndash;&ndash;a dirty
business for us both. I admit it. But can&#8217;t we do it
reasonably? Can&#8217;t we do it alone? Why introduce
this ill-born whelp? He&#8217;s making trouble, Top; and
he&#8217;ll make more with every year he lives. Let him
shift for himself, man! I care nothing about him.
What was his father to me? What was his mother?
Make him a cook on a trader. Make him a hand on a
Labradorman. Put him before the mast on a foreign
craft. What do I care? Let him go! Give him a
hook and line. A paddle-punt is patrimony enough
for the like of him. Will you never listen to reason?
What&#8217;s the lad to you? Damn him, say I! Let him&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For that,&#8221; my uncle interrupted, in a passion, &#8220;I&#8217;ll
hurt ye! Come soon, come late, I&#8217;ll hurt ye! Hear
me?&#8221; he continued, savagely. &#8220;I&#8217;ll hurt ye for them
evil wishes!&#8221;</p>
<p>I had expected this outbreak. My uncle would not
hear me damned in this cruel way without protest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Top,&#8221; says the stranger, with a little laugh of scorn,
&#8220;when <i>you</i> hurt <i>me</i>&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;ll know that the chieftest knave
of the St. John&#8217;s water-side has turned fool!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></div>
<p>&#8220;When I hurts ye, man,&#8221; my uncle answered, &#8220;I&#8217;ll
hurt ye sore!&#8221;</p>
<p>Again the man laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, man!&#8221; my uncle growled, &#8220;but ye&#8217;ll squirm
for that when the time comes!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, come, Top!&#8221; says the stranger, in such a
whine of terror, in such disgusting weakness and
sudden withdrawal of high boasting, in such a failure
of courage, that I could hardly credit the thing.
&#8220;Come, come, Top!&#8221; he whined. &#8220;You&#8217;ll do nothing
rash, will you? Not <i>rash</i>, Top&ndash;&ndash;not rash!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll make ye squirm, sir,&#8221; says my uncle, &#8220;for
damnin&#8217; Dannie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;ll do nothing rash, man, will you?&#8221;</p>
<p>My uncle would not heed him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a reasonable man, Top,&#8221; the stranger protested.
&#8220;You know I&#8217;m not a hard man.&#8221;</p>
<p>They moved, now, into the dining-room, whence no
word of what they said came to my ears. I listened,
lying wide-eared in the dark, but heard only a rumble
of voices. &#8220;And you, too&ndash;&ndash;you hound!&#8221; the man had
said; and &#8217;twas spoken in the hate that forebodes
murder. My uncle? what had that childlike, tenderhearted
old rascal accomplished against this man to
make the penalty of ungodly wrath a thing meet to the
offence? &#8220;And you, too&ndash;&ndash;you hound!&#8221; I lay in grave
trouble and bewilderment, fearing that this strange
guest might work his hate upon my uncle, in some explosion
of resentment, before my arm could aid against
the deed. There was no sound of laughter from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
below&ndash;&ndash;no hint of conviviality in the intercourse. Voices
and the clink of bottle and glass: nothing mellow in
the voices, nothing genial in the clink of glass&ndash;&ndash;nothing
friendly or hospitable. &#8217;Twas an uneasy occupation
that engaged me; no good, as I knew, came from a
surly bout with a bottle of rum. &#8217;Twas still blowing
high; the windows rattled, the sea broke in thunder
and venomous hissing upon the rocks, the wind screamed
its complaint of obstruction; &#8217;twas a tumultuous
night, wherein, it seems to me, the passions of men
are not overawed by any display of inimical power,
but break restraint in evil company with the weather.
The voices below, as I hearkened, rose and fell, like
the gusts of a gale, falling to quiet confidences, lost in
the roar of the night, swiftly rising to threat and angry
counter-threat.</p>
<p>It ended in a cry and a crash of glass....</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>I was by this brought out of bed and pattering down
the stair to my uncle&#8217;s help. It seemed they did not
hear me, or, having heard, were enraged past caring
who saw them in this evil case. At the door I came to
a stand. There was no encounter, no movement at
all, within the room; &#8217;twas very quiet and very still.
There had fallen upon the world that pregnant silence,
wherein men wait appalled, which follows upon the
irrevocable act of a quarrel. A bottle of rum was overturned
on the table, and a glass lay in splinters on the
hearth at my uncle&#8217;s back, as though cast with poor
aim. The place reeked with the stench of rum, which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
rose from a river of liquor, overflowing the table, dripping
to the floor: a foul and sinister detail, I recall, of
the tableau. My uncle and the gray little man from
St. John&#8217;s, leaning upon their hands, the table between,
faced each other all too close for peaceful issue of the
broil. Beyond was my uncle&#8217;s hand-lamp, where I
had set it, burning serenely in this tempest of passion.
The faces were silhouetted in profile against its quiet
yellow light. Monstrous shadows of the antagonists
were cast upon the table and ceiling. For the first
time in my life I clapped eyes on the man from St.
John&#8217;s; but his face was in shadow&ndash;&ndash;I saw dimly.
&#8217;Twas clean-shaven and gray: I could tell no more.
But yet, I knew, the man was a man of some distinction&ndash;&ndash;a
gentleman. &#8217;Twas a definite impression I had.
There was that about him&ndash;&ndash;clothes and carriage and
shaven face and lean white hands&ndash;&ndash;that fixed it in my
memory.</p>
<p>I was not observed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Out there on the Devil&#8217;s Teeth,&#8221; my uncle impassively
began, &#8220;when I laid hold&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; the stranger protested, &#8220;I have nothing to do
with that!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Out there on the Devil&#8217;s Teeth, that night,&#8221; my
uncle repeated, &#8220;when the seas was breakin&#8217; over, an&#8217;
the ice begin t&#8217; come, an&#8217; I laid hold o&#8217; that there
Book&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hear me, Top! Will you <i>not</i> hear me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Out there on the Devil&#8217;s Teeth,&#8221; my uncle patiently
reiterated, &#8220;when the crew was drownin&#8217; t&#8217; le&#8217;ward,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
an&#8217; &#8217;twas every man for his own life, an&#8217; the ice begin
t&#8217; come, an&#8217; I laid hold o&#8217; that there&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The stranger struck the table with his palm. &#8220;Hear
me!&#8221; he implored. &#8220;I have nothing&ndash;&ndash;nothing&ndash;&ndash;to do
with the Devil&#8217;s Teeth!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Out there on the Devil&#8217;s Teeth, when I took the
oath&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You stupid fool!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I took the oath,&#8221; my uncle resumed, &#8220;I
knowed &#8217;twould be hard t&#8217; stand by. I knowed that,
sir. I done the thing with open eyes. I&#8217;ll never plead
ignorance afore the Lord God A&#8217;mighty, sir, for the
words I spoke that night. I&#8217;ve stood by, as best I
could; an&#8217; I&#8217;ll keep on standin&#8217; by, sir, t&#8217; the end, as
best I&#8217;m able. God help me, sir!&#8221; he groaned, leaning
still closer to the gray face of his enemy. &#8220;Ye think
ye&#8217;re in hard case, yourself, sir, don&#8217;t ye? Do ye never
give a thought t&#8217; <i>me?</i> Dirty business, says you, betwixt
you an&#8217; me! Ay; dirty business for Nick Top. But
he&#8217;ll stand by; he&#8217;ll stand by, sir, come what may&ndash;&ndash;t&#8217;
the end! I&#8217;m not complainin&#8217;, mark ye! not complainin&#8217;
at all. The lad&#8217;s a good lad. I&#8217;m not complainin&#8217;.
He&#8217;ve the makin&#8217;s of a better man than you.
Oh no! I&#8217;m not complainin&#8217;. Out there on the Devil&#8217;s
Teeth, that night, when the souls o&#8217; them men was goin&#8217;
Aloft an&#8217; Below, accordin&#8217; t&#8217; their deserts, does ye think
I was a fool? Fool! I tells ye, sir, I knowed full well
I give my soul t&#8217; hell, that night, when I laid my hand
on the Book an&#8217; swore that I&#8217;d stand by. An&#8217; I <i>will</i>
stand by&ndash;&ndash;stand by the lad, sir, t&#8217; the end! He&#8217;s a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
good lad&ndash;&ndash;he&#8217;ll make a better man than you&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; I&#8217;ve
no word o&#8217; complaint t&#8217; say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The lad, the lad! Do <i>I</i> care for the lad?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, God forgive ye!&#8221; my uncle cried, &#8220;not you
that ought.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That ought, you fool?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay; that ought.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not have ye laugh,&#8221; said my uncle, &#8220;at Dannie.
Ye&#8217;ve tried my patience enough with scorn o&#8217; that
child.&#8221; He tapped the table imperatively, continuing
with rising anger, and scowled in a way I had learned
to take warning from. &#8220;No more o&#8217; that!&#8221; says he.
&#8220;Ye&#8217;ve no call t&#8217; laugh at the lad.&#8221;</p>
<p>The laughter ceased&ndash;&ndash;failed ridiculously. It proved
my uncle&#8217;s mastery of the situation. The man might
bluster, but was in a moment reduced.</p>
<p>&#8220;Top,&#8221; said the stranger, leaning forward a little,
&#8220;I have asked you a simple question: <i>Will</i> you or
<i>won&#8217;t</i> you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not!&#8221;</p>
<p>In exasperation the man struck my uncle on the cheek.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not hurt ye for that!&#8221; said my uncle, gently.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll not hurt ye, man, for that!&#8221;</p>
<p>He was struck again. &#8220;There will come an extremity,&#8221;
the stranger calmly added, &#8220;when I shall
find it expedient to have you assassinated.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not hurt ye for the threat,&#8221; said my uncle.
&#8220;But man,&#8221; he cried, in savage anger, &#8220;an you keeps
me from workin&#8217; my will with the lad&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span></div>
<p>&#8220;The lad, the lad!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An you keeps me from workin&#8217; my will with that
good lad&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I say to you frankly: Damn the lad!&#8221;</p>
<p>My uncle struck the stranger. &#8220;Ye&#8217;ll mend your
manners!&#8221; cried he. &#8220;Ye&#8217;ve forgot your obligations,
but ye&#8217;ll mend your manners!&#8221;</p>
<p>I marvelled that these men should strike each other
with impunity. The like was never known before.
That each should patiently bear the insult of the other!
I could not make it out. &#8217;Twas strange beyond experience.
A blow&ndash;&ndash;and the other cheek turned! Well
enough for Christians&ndash;&ndash;but my vicious uncle and this
evil stranger! That night, while I watched and listened
unperceived from the hall, I could not understand;
but now I know that a fellowship of wickedness
was signified.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not hurt you, Top,&#8221; the stranger mocked, &#8220;for
the blow.&#8221;</p>
<p>My uncle laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you laughing, Top?&#8221; the stranger sneered.
&#8220;You are, aren&#8217;t you? Well,&#8221; says he, &#8220;who laughs
last laughs best. And I tell you, Top, though you
may seem to have the best laugh now, I&#8217;ll have the
last. And you won&#8217;t like it, Top&ndash;&ndash;you won&#8217;t be happy
when you hear me.&#8221;</p>
<p>My uncle laughed again. I wish he had not
laughed&ndash;&ndash;not in that unkind way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyhow,&#8221; said the stranger, &#8220;take that with my
compliments!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span></div>
<p>&#8217;Twas a brutal blow with the closed fist. I cried
out. My uncle, with the sting and humiliation of the
thing to forbear, was deaf to the cry; but the gray
little man from St. John&#8217;s, who knew well enough he
would have no buffet in return, turned, startled, and
saw me. My uncle&#8217;s glance instantly followed; whereupon
a singular thing happened. The old man&ndash;&ndash;I recall
the horror with which he discovered me&ndash;&ndash;swept the
lamp from the table with a swing of his hand. It
hurtled like a star, crashed against the wall, fell shattered
and extinguished. We were in darkness&ndash;&ndash;and
in silence. For a long interval no word was spoken;
the gale was free to noise itself upon our ears&ndash;&ndash;the
patter of rain, the howl of the wind, the fretful breaking;
of the sea.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dannie, lad,&#8221; says my uncle, at last, &#8220;is that you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; says he, tenderly, &#8220;I &#8217;low you&#8217;d best be t&#8217;
bed. I&#8217;m feared you&#8217;ll be cotchin&#8217; cold, there in the
draught, in your night-gown. Ye&#8217;re so wonderful
quick, lad, t&#8217; cotch cold.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve come, sir,&#8221; says I, &#8220;t&#8217; your aid.&#8221;</p>
<p>The stranger tittered.</p>
<p>&#8220;T&#8217; your aid, sir!&#8221; I shouted, defiantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not needin&#8217; ye, Dannie. Ye&#8217;re best in bed.
&#8217;Tis so wonderful late. I &#8217;low ye&#8217;ll be havin&#8217; the croup
again, lad, an you don&#8217;t watch out. An&#8217; ye mustn&#8217;t
have the croup; ye really mustn&#8217;t! Remember the
last time, Dannie, an&#8217; beware. Ah, now! ye&#8217;ll never
have the croup an ye can help it. Think,&#8221; he pleaded,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
&#8220;o&#8217; the hot-water cloths, an&#8217; the fear ye put me to.
An&#8217; Dannie,&#8221; he added, accusingly, &#8220;ye know the
ipecac is all runned out!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll stand by, sir,&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis kind o&#8217; you!&#8221; my uncle exclaimed, with infinite
graciousness and affection. &#8220;&#8217;Tis wonderful kind!
An&#8217; I&#8217;m glad ye&#8217;re kind t&#8217; me now&ndash;&ndash;with my ol&#8217; shipmate
here. But you isn&#8217;t needed, lad; so do you go
t&#8217; bed like the good b&#8217;y that you is. Go t&#8217; bed, Dannie,
God bless ye!&ndash;&ndash;go t&#8217; bed, an&#8217; go t&#8217; sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; I complained; &#8220;but I&#8217;m not wantin&#8217; t&#8217; leave
ye with this man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;True, an&#8217; I&#8217;m proud of it,&#8221; says he; &#8220;but I&#8217;ve no
means o&#8217; curin&#8217; the croup. An&#8217; Dannie,&#8221; says he,
&#8220;I&#8217;m more feared o&#8217; the croup than o&#8217; the devil. Do
you go t&#8217; bed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go,&#8221; I answered, &#8220;an you wills it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas very dark in the dining-room; there was no
sight of the geometrical gentlemen on that geometrically
tempestuous sea to stay a lad in his defiance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good lad!&#8221; said my uncle. &#8220;God bless ye!&#8221;</p>
<p>On the landing above I encountered my tutor, half-dressed,
a candle in hand. &#8217;Twas a queer figure he
cut, thinks I&ndash;&ndash;an odd, inconsequent figure in a mysterious
broil of the men of our kind. What was this
cockney&ndash;&ndash;this wretched alien&ndash;&ndash;when the passions of
our coast were stirring? He would be better in bed.
An eye he had&ndash;&ndash;age-wise ways and a glance to overawe
my youth&ndash;&ndash;but what was he, after all, in such a
case as this? I was his master, however unlearned I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
might be; his elder and master, to be sure, in a broil
of our folk. Though to this day I respect the man for
his manifold virtues, forgetting in magnanimity his
failings, I cannot forgive his appearance on that night:
the candle, the touselled hair, the disarray, the lean
legs of him! &#8220;What&#8217;s all this?&#8221; he demanded. &#8220;I
can&#8217;t sleep. What&#8217;s all this about? Is it a burglar?&#8221;</p>
<p>It made me impatient&ndash;&ndash;and no wonder!</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this, you know?&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;Eh?
What&#8217;s all this row?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you go t&#8217; bed!&#8221; I commanded, with a stamp,
quite out of temper. &#8220;Ye&#8217;re but a child! Ye&#8217;ve no
hand in this!&#8221;</p>
<p>He was dutiful....</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>By-and-by my uncle came to my room. He would
not enter, but stood at the door, in much embarrassment,
all the while looking at the flame of his candle.
&#8220;Dannie, lad,&#8221; he inquired, at last, &#8220;is you comfortable?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, sir,&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; happy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; is you content,&#8221; says he, &#8220;all alone with ol&#8217;
Nick Top at Twist Tickle?&#8221;</p>
<p>I was content.</p>
<p>&#8220;You isn&#8217;t upsot, is you, by the capers o&#8217; my ol&#8217;
shipmate?&#8221;</p>
<p>I answered as he wished. &#8220;No, sir,&#8221; said I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh no,&#8221; says he; &#8220;no need o&#8217; bein&#8217; upsot by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
<i>that</i> ol&#8217; bully. He&#8217;ve wonderful queer ways, I&#8217;ll not
deny, but ye&#8217;re not in the way o&#8217; knowin&#8217;, Dannie,
that he&#8217;ve not a good heart. I &#8217;low ye&#8217;ll maybe take
to un, lad&ndash;&ndash;when you comes t&#8217; know un better. I
hopes ye will. I hopes ye&#8217;ll find it easy t&#8217; deal with
un. They&#8217;s no need <i>now</i> o&#8217; bein&#8217; upsot; oh my, no!
But, Dannie, an I was you,&#8221; says he, a bit hopelessly,
&#8220;times bein&#8217; what they is, an&#8217; life uncertain&ndash;&ndash;an I was
you, lad&ndash;&ndash;afore I went t&#8217; sleep I&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;I &#8217;low I&#8217;d overhaul
that there twenty-third psa&#8217;m!&#8221;</p>
<p>He went away then....</p>

<h2>XII</h2>
<h3>NEED O&#8217; HASTE</h3>
</div>
<p>When I awoke &#8217;twas to a gray morning. The wind
had fallen to half a gale for stout craft&ndash;&ndash;continuing
in the east, the rain gone out of it. Fog had come
upon the islands at dawn; &#8217;twas now everywhere settled
thick&ndash;&ndash;the hills lost to sight, the harbor water black and
illimitable, the world all soggy and muffled. There was
a great noise of breakers upon the seaward rocks. A
high sea running without (they said); but yet my uncle
had manned a trap-skiff at dawn (said they) to put a
stranger across to Topmast Point. A gentleman &#8217;twas
(said they)&ndash;&ndash;a gray little man with a red mole at the
tip of his nose, who had lain the night patiently enough
at Skipper Eli Flack&#8217;s, but must be off at break o&#8217; day,
come what might, to board the outside boat for St.
John&#8217;s at Topmast Harbor. He had gone in high good-humor;
crackin&#8217; off along o&#8217; Skipper Nick (said Eli)
like he&#8217;d knowed un all his life. An&#8217; Nick? why, ecod!
Nick was crackin&#8217; off, too. Never <i>knowed</i> such crackin&#8217;
off atween strangers. You could hear the crew laughin&#8217;
clear t&#8217; the narrows. &#8217;Twould be a lovely cruise!
Rough passage, t&#8217; be sure; but Nick could take a skiff
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
through <i>that</i>! An&#8217; Nick would <i>drive</i> her, ecod! you&#8217;d
see ol&#8217; Nick wing it back through the narrows afore the
night was down if the wind held easterly. <i>He&#8217;d</i> be the
b&#8217;y t&#8217; put she to it!</p>
<p>I scanned the sky and sea.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; quoth Eli, of the gale; &#8220;she haven&#8217;t spit out
all she&#8217;ve got. She quit in a temper, at dawn,&#8221; says he,
&#8220;an&#8217; she&#8217;ll be back afore night t&#8217; ease her mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas a dismal prospect for my uncle.</p>
<p>&#8220;But &#8217;twould be a clever gale at flirtin&#8217;,&#8221; Eli added,
for my comfort, &#8220;that could delude an&#8217; overcome ol&#8217;
Nick!&#8221;</p>
<p>My tutor would go walking upon the roads and heads
of our harbor (said he) to learn of this new world into
which he had come in the dark. &#8217;Twas gray and windy
and dripping on the hills; but I led him (though his
flimsy protection against the weather liked me not) over
the Whisper Cove road to the cliffs of Tom Tulk&#8217;s Head,
diligently exercising, as we went, for my profit and his
befitting entertainment, all the Chesterfieldian phrases
&#8217;twas in me to recall. &#8217;Twas easy to perceive his delight
in this manner of speech: &#8217;twas a thing so manifest,
indeed, such was the exuberance of his laughter and so
often did he clap me on the back, that I was fairly
abashed by the triumph, and could not for the life of me
continue, but must descend, for lack of spirit, to the
common tongue of our folk, which did him well enough,
after all, it seemed. It pleased him mightily to be set
on the crest and brink of that great cliff, high in the
mist, the gray wind blowing by, the black sea careering
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
from an ambush of fog to break in wrathful assault upon
the grim rocks below. &#8217;Twas amazing: the slender
figure drawn in glee to breast the gale, the long arms
opened to the wind, the rapt, dark face, the flashing
eyes, the deep, eager breaths like sighs of rapture. A
rhapsody: the rush and growl and frown of the world
(said he)&ndash;&ndash;the sombre colors, the veil of mist, the everlasting
hills, rising in serenity above the turmoil and
evanescent rage. To this I listened in wonder. I had
not for myself discovered these beauties; but thereafter,
because of this teaching, I kept watch.</p>
<p>Came, then, out of the mist, Judith, upon accustomed
business. &#8220;Dannie, lad,&#8221; she asked me, not shy of the
stranger, because of woful anxiety, &#8220;you&#8217;ve not seed my
mother hereabouts, is you?&#8221;</p>
<p>I grieved that I had not.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ve been gone,&#8221; said Judith, with a helpless
glance, sweeping the sombre, veiled hills, &#8220;since afore
dawn. I waked at dawn, Dannie, an&#8217; she were gone
from the bed&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; I isn&#8217;t been able t&#8217; find she, somehow.
She&#8217;ve wandered off&ndash;&ndash;she&#8217;ve wandered off again&ndash;&ndash;in
her way.&#8221;</p>
<p>I would help, said I.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re kind, Dannie,&#8221; said she. &#8220;Ay, God&#8217;s sake,
lad! you&#8217;re wondrous kind&ndash;&ndash;t&#8217; me.&#8221;</p>
<p>My tutor tipped the sad little face, as though by right
and propriety admitted long ago, and for a moment
looked unabashed into Judith&#8217;s eyes&ndash;&ndash;an engaging
glance, it seemed, for Judith was left unresisting and
untroubled by it. They were eyes, now, speaking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
anxious fear and weariness and motherly concern, the
brows drawn, the tragic little shadows, lying below,
very wide and blue.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a pretty child,&#8221; said my tutor, presently;
&#8220;you have very beautiful eyes, have you not? But you
knew it long ago, of course,&#8221; he added, smiling in a way
most captivating, &#8220;didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>I remember the day&ndash;&ndash;the mist and wind and clamoring
sea and solemn hills, the dour, ill-tempered world
wherein we were, our days as grass (saith the psalmist).
Ay, an&#8217; &#8217;tis so. I remember the day: the wet moss
underfoot; the cold wind, blowing as it listed; the petulant
sea, wreaking an ancient enmity, old and to continue
beyond our span of feeling; the great hills of Twin
Islands hid in mist, but yet watching us; the clammy
fog embracing us, three young, unknowing souls. I
shall not forget&ndash;&ndash;cannot forget&ndash;&ndash;the moment of that first
meeting of the maid Judith with John Cather. &#8217;Twas
a sombre day, as he had said&ndash;&ndash;ay, a troubled sea, a
gray, cold, sodden earth!</p>
<p>&#8220;And has nobody told you that you were pretty?&#8221;
my tutor ran on, in pleasant banter.</p>
<p>She would not answer; but shyly, in sweet self-consciousness,
looked down.</p>
<p>&#8220;No?&#8221; he insisted.</p>
<p>She was too shy of him to say.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not even one?&#8221; he persisted, tipping up the
blushing little face. &#8220;Not even one?&#8221;</p>
<p>I thought it very bold.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Come, now,&#8221; says he. &#8220;There is a boy. You are
so very pretty, you know. You are so very, very pretty.
There must be a boy&ndash;&ndash;a sweetheart. Surely there is
at least one lad of taste at Twist Tickle. There is
a sweetheart; there must be a sweetheart. I spell it
with a D!&#8221; cries he, triumphantly, detecting the horrified
glance that passed between Judy and me. And
he clapped me on the back, and stroked Judith&#8217;s
tawny hair, his hand bold, winning; and he laughed
most heartily. &#8220;His name,&#8221; says he, &#8220;is Daniel!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; said Judith, quite frankly.</p>
<p>My tutor laughed again; and I was glad that he did&ndash;&ndash;in
that kind way. I was glad&ndash;&ndash;&#8217;twas a flush of warm
feeling&ndash;&ndash;that my tutor and Judith were at once upon
terms of understanding. I was glad that Judith smiled,
glad that she looked again, with favor, in interested
speculation, into the dark eyes which smiled back at
her again. I would have them friends&ndash;&ndash;&#8217;twas according
to my plan....</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>At mid-day the wrath of the sea began to fail. The
racing lop, the eager, fuming crests&ndash;&ndash;a black-and-white
confusion beneath the quiet, gray fog&ndash;&ndash;subsided into
reasonableness. &#8217;Twas wild enough, wind and sea,
beyond the tickle rocks; but still &#8217;twas fishing weather
and water for the courageous.</p>
<p>The fool of Twist Tickle came to our gate. &#8220;Mother
always &#8217;lowed,&#8221; says he, &#8220;that when a man <i>could</i> he
<i>ought</i> t&#8217;; an&#8217; mother knowed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re never bound out, Moses!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he drawled, &#8220;mother always &#8217;lowed that
when a man <i>could</i> pick up a scattered fish an&#8217; <i>wouldn&#8217;t</i>,
he were a mean sort o&#8217; coward.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; you&#8217;ll be takin&#8217; <i>me</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was &#8217;lowin&#8217;,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;that us <i>might</i> get out
an&#8217; back an us tried.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas a brave prospect. Beyond the tickle in a
gale o wind! &#8217;Twas irresistible&ndash;&ndash;to be accomplished
with the fool of Twist Tickle and his clever punt. I
left the pottering Cather to put ship-shape his cabin
(as he now called it) for himself&ndash;&ndash;a rainy-day occupation
for aliens. In high delight I put out with Moses
Shoos to the Off-and-On grounds. Man&#8217;s work, this!
&#8217;Twas hard sailing for a hook-and-line punt&ndash;&ndash;the reel
and rush and splash of it&ndash;&ndash;but an employment the most
engaging. &#8217;Twas worse fishing in the toss and smother
of the grounds; but &#8217;twas a thrilling reward when the
catch came flopping overside&ndash;&ndash;the spoil of a doughty
foray. We fished a clean half-quintal; then, late in
the day, a rising wind caught us napping in Hell Alley.
It came on to blow from the east with fury. There was
no beating up to the tickle in the teeth of it; &#8217;twas a
task beyond the little punt, drive her to it as we would.
When dusk came&ndash;&ndash;dusk fast turning the fog black&ndash;&ndash;the
fool turned tail and wisely ran for Whisper Cove.
&#8217;Twas dark when we moored the punt to the stage-head:
a black night come again, blowing wildly with rain&ndash;&ndash;great
gusts of wind threshing the trees above, screaming
from cliff to cliff. There were lights at Judith&#8217;s: &#8217;twas
straightway in our minds to ask a cup of tea in her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
kitchen; but when we came near the door &#8217;twas to the
discovery of company moving in and out.</p>
<p>There were women in the kitchen.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis Judith&#8217;s mother, Dannie,&#8221; Aunt Esther All
whispered. &#8220;&#8217;Tis on&#8217;y she. &#8217;Tis on&#8217;y Elizabeth.&#8221;</p>
<p>We had found her on the hills that morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ve come t&#8217; die all of a suddent. &#8217;Tis another
of her spells. Oh, Lord! she&#8217;ve come t&#8217; die.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no solemnity in this outer room.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ve woful need o&#8217; salvation,&#8221; Aunt Esther pattered.
&#8220;She&#8217;s doomed, lad, an she doesn&#8217;t repent.
Parson Stump ought t&#8217; be fetched t&#8217; work on she.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was grief&ndash;&ndash;somewhere there was grief. I heard
a sob; it came from a child&#8217;s breast. And there followed,
then, some strange, rambling words of comfort
in Elizabeth&#8217;s voice&ndash;&ndash;a plea, it was, to never mind.
Again a sob&ndash;&ndash;Judith&#8217;s grief.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis Judith,&#8221; Aunt Esther sighed. &#8220;She&#8217;ve gone
an&#8217; give way.&#8221;</p>
<p>The child&#8217;s heart would break!</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother always &#8217;lowed, Dannie,&#8221; Moses whispered,
&#8220;that they ought t&#8217; be a parson handy&ndash;&ndash;when It come.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas beyond the power of the fool to manage: who
was now a fool, indeed&ndash;&ndash;white and shivering in this
Presence. I would fetch the parson, said I&ndash;&ndash;and
moved right willingly and in haste upon the errand.
Aunt Esther followed me beyond the threshold. She
caught my arm with such a grasp that I was brought
up in surprise. We stood in the wind and rain. The
light from the kitchen fell through the doorway into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
the black night. Aunt Esther&#8217;s lean, brown face, as
the lamp betrayed, was working with eager and shameless
curiosity. They had wondered, these women of
Whisper Cove, overlong and without patience, to know
what they wished to know but could not discover.
&#8220;She&#8217;ve been wantin&#8217; Skipper Nicholas,&#8221; says she.
&#8220;She&#8217;ve been callin&#8217; for Skipper Nicholas. She&#8217;ve been
singin&#8217; out, Dannie, like a wretch in tarture. Tell un
t&#8217; come. She&#8217;ve been wantin&#8217; un sore. She&#8217;ve a thing
on her mind. Tell un not t&#8217; fail. &#8217;Tis something she&#8217;ve
t&#8217; tell un. &#8216;I wants Skipper Nicholas!&#8217; says she.
&#8216;Fetch Nicholas! I wants a word with he afore I die.&#8217;
Hist!&#8221; Aunt Esther added, as though imparting some
delight, &#8220;I &#8217;low &#8217;tis the secret.&#8221;</p>
<p>I asked her concerning this secret.</p>
<p>&#8220;It haves t&#8217; do,&#8221; says she, &#8220;with Judith.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; what&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>
<p>She whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;For shame!&#8221; I cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, but,&#8221; says she, &#8220;you isn&#8217;t a woman!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis gossips&#8217; employment, woman!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis a woman&#8217;s wish t&#8217; know,&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p>The thing concerned Judith: I was angered....</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>And now the door was shut in my face. &#8217;Twas
opened&ndash;&ndash;closed again. The fool fled past me to his
own place&ndash;&ndash;scared off by the footsteps of Death, in the
way of all fools. I was in haste&ndash;&ndash;all at once&ndash;&ndash;upon the
road from Whisper Cove to Twist Tickle in a screaming
gale of wind and rain. I was in Judith&#8217;s service: I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
made haste. &#8217;Twas a rough road, as I have said&ndash;&ndash;a
road scrambling among forsaken hills, a path made
by chance, narrow and crooked, wind-swept or walled
by reaching alders and spruce limbs, which were wet
and cold and heavy with the drip of the gale. Ah, but
was I not whipped on that night by the dark and the
sweeping rain and the wind on the black hills and the
approach of death? I was whipped on, indeed! The
road was perverse to hurrying feet: &#8217;twas ill going for
a crooked foot; but I ran&ndash;&ndash;splashing through the puddles,
stumbling over protruding rock, crawling over the
hills&ndash;&ndash;an unpitying course. Why did the woman cry
out for my uncle? What would she confide? Was it,
indeed, but the name of the man? Was it not more
vital to Judith&#8217;s welfare, imperatively demanding disclosure?
I hastened. Was my uncle at home? For
Elizabeth&#8217;s peace at this dread pass I hoped he had
won through the gale. In rising anxiety I ran faster.
I tripped upon a root and went tumbling down Lovers&#8217;
Hill, coming to in a muddy torrent from Tom Tulk&#8217;s
Head. Thereafter&ndash;&ndash;a hundred paces&ndash;&ndash;I caught sight
of the lights of the Twist Tickle meeting-house. They
glowed warm and bright in the scowling night that
encompassed me....</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&#8217;Twas district-meeting time at Twist Tickle. The
parsons of our Bay were gathered to devise many kindnesses
for our folk&ndash;&ndash;the salvation of souls and the
nourishment of bodies and the praise of the God of us
all. &#8217;Twas in sincerity they came&ndash;&ndash;there&#8217;s no disputing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
it&ndash;&ndash;and in loving-kindness, however ingenuously, they
sought our welfare. When I came from the unkind
night into the light and warmth of that plain temple,
Parson Lute, of Yellow Tail Tickle, whom I knew and
loved, was seeking to persuade the shepherds of our
souls that the spread of saving grace might surely be
accomplished, from Toad Point to the Scarlet Woman&#8217;s
Head, by means of unmitigated doctrine and more artful
discourse. He was a youngish man, threadbare and
puckered of garment&ndash;&ndash;a quivering little aggregation of
bones and blood-vessels, with a lean, lipless, high-cheeked
face, its pale surface splashed with freckles; green eyes,
red-rimmed, the lashes sparse and white; wide, restless
nostrils. &#8220;Brethren,&#8221; said he, with a snap of the
teeth, his bony hand clinched and shaking above
his gigantic head, &#8220;con-<i>vict</i> &#8217;em! Anyhow. In any
way. By any means. <i>Save</i> &#8217;em! That&#8217;s what we
want in the church. Beloved,&#8221; he proceeded, his voice
dropping to a hissing whisper, &#8220;save &#8217;em. <i>Con</i>-vict
&#8217;em!&#8221; His head shot forward; &#8217;twas a red, bristly head,
with the hair growing low on the brow, like the spruce
of an overhanging cliff. &#8220;It&#8217;s the only <i>way</i>,&#8221; he concluded,
&#8220;to save &#8217;em!&#8221; He sat down. &#8220;I&#8217;m hungry
for souls!&#8221; he shouted from his seat, as an afterthought;
and &#8217;twas plain he would have said more had not a
spasmodic cough put an end to his ecstasy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Praise God!&#8221; they said.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Low I got a cold,&#8221; Parson Lute gasped, his voice
changed now by the weakness of an ailing man.</p>
<p>I feared to interrupt; but still must boldly knock.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span></div>
<p>&#8220;One moment, brethren!&#8221; Parson Stump apologized.
&#8220;Ah, Daniel!&#8221; he cried; &#8220;is that you? What&#8217;s amiss,
boy? You&#8217;ve no trouble, have you? And your uncle&ndash;&ndash;eh?
you&#8217;ve no trouble, boy, have you?&#8221; The brethren
waited in silence while he tripped lightly over the
worn cocoanut matting to the rear&ndash;&ndash;perturbed, a little
frown of impatience and bewilderment gathering between
his eyes. The tails of his shiny black coat
brushed the varnished pine pews, whereto, every Sunday,
the simple folk of our harbor repaired in faith.
Presently he tripped back again. The frown of bewilderment
was deeper now&ndash;&ndash;the perturbation turned
anxious. For a moment he paused before the brethren.
&#8220;Very awkward,&#8221; said he, at last. &#8220;Really, I&#8217;m very
sorry.&#8221; He scratched his head, fore and aft&ndash;&ndash;bit his
lip. &#8220;I&#8217;m called to Whisper Cove,&#8221; he explained, pulling
at his nose. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry to interrupt the business of
the meeting, just at this time, but I do not see how it
can be got around. I s&#8217;pose we&#8217;d better adjourn until
such a time as I&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The chairman would hear of no adjournment.</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; Parson Stump complained, &#8220;I&#8217;m the secretary!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll go right on, brother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t very well <i>stay</i>, brethren,&#8221; said Parson Stump,
chagrined. &#8220;It&#8217;s a case of&ndash;&ndash;of&ndash;&ndash;of spiritual consolation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; ejaculated Parson Lute.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Brother Wile,&#8221; the chairman interrupted,
&#8220;we&#8217;re ready to hear <i>you</i>.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span></div>
<p>&#8220;One moment,&#8221; said Parson Lute, rising. He struggled
to suppress his cough. &#8220;Excuse me,&#8221; he gasped.
And, &#8220;I don&#8217;t quite see, brethren,&#8221; he proceeded, &#8220;how
this meeting can get along without the services of
Brother Stump. It seems to me that this meeting <i>needs</i>
Brother Stump. I am of opinion that Brother Stump
owes it to the cause in general, and to the clergy of this
district in particular, to report this discussion to the
conference. It is my conviction, brethren, that Brother
Stump&ndash;&ndash;by his indefatigable industry, by his thorough
acquaintance with the matters under discussion, by his
spiritual insight into problems of this character, by his
talent for expression&ndash;&ndash;ought to be present through the
whole of this discussion, in its entirety, and ought to
present the views of this body to the conference <i>in
person</i>.&#8221; And, &#8220;Look here, Brother Stump,&#8221; he concluded,
turning, &#8220;why can&#8217;t <i>I</i> make this call for you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, of course, you <i>could</i>, Brother Lute,&#8221; Parson
Stump admitted, his face beginning to clear, &#8220;but really
I&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, come now, brother!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Brother Lute,&#8221; said Parson Stump, with sincere
affection, &#8220;I don&#8217;t like to think of you on the road to
Whisper Cove to-night. I tell you, it&ndash;&ndash;it&ndash;&ndash;goes against
the grain. You&#8217;re not well, brother. You&#8217;re not well
at all. And it&#8217;s a long way&ndash;&ndash;and there&#8217;s a gale of wind
and rain outside&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, come, now!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A <i>dirty</i> night,&#8221; Parson Stump mused.</p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s the Lord&#8217;s business!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; Parson Stump yielded, &#8220;if you <i>would</i>
be so kind, I&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Parson Lute&#8217;s face brightened. &#8220;Very well,&#8221; said
he. &#8220;It&#8217;s all settled. Now, may I have a word with
you? I&#8217;ll need some pointers.&#8221; To the five brethren:
&#8220;One moment, brethren!&#8221;</p>
<p>They moved towards the rear, and came to rest,
heads close, within my hearing. Parson Lute put his
arm over Parson Stump&#8217;s shoulder. &#8220;Now,&#8221; said he,
briskly, rubbing his hands in a business-like way,
&#8220;pointers, brother&ndash;&ndash;pointers!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, brother!&#8221; Parson Stump agreed. &#8220;Well,
you&#8217;ll find my oil-skins hanging in the hall. Mrs. Stump
will give you the lantern&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no! I don&#8217;t mean that. Who is this person?
Man or woman?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maid,&#8221; said Parson Stump.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221;</p>
<p>Parson Stump whispered in Parson Lute&#8217;s ear.
Parson Lute raised his eyebrows. He was made sad&ndash;&ndash;and
sighed. He was kind, was this parson, and sweetly
wishful for the goodness and welfare of all the erring
sons and daughters of men.</p>
<p>&#8220;Has the woman repented?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I fear not. In fact&ndash;&ndash;no; she has not.&#8221;</p>
<p>At once the battle-light began to shine in Parson
Lute&#8217;s green eyes. &#8220;I see,&#8221; he snapped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rather difficult case, I fear,&#8221; said Parson Stump,
despondently. &#8220;She&ndash;&ndash;well, she&ndash;&ndash;she isn&#8217;t quite right.
Poor creature! Do you understand? A simple person.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
Not idiotic, you know. Not born that way, of course.
Oh no! born with all her senses <i>quite</i> intact. She was
beautiful as a maid&ndash;&ndash;sweet-natured, lovely in person,
very modest and pious&ndash;&ndash;very merry, too, and clever.
But before the child came she&ndash;&ndash;she&ndash;&ndash;she began to wait.
Do you understand? To wait&ndash;&ndash;to wait for the return
of&ndash;&ndash;of some one. She said&ndash;&ndash;I remember that she said&ndash;&ndash;that
he would come. She was really quite sure of it.
And she waited&ndash;&ndash;and waited. A promise, no doubt;
and she had faith in it. For a long time she had faith
in it. Rather pitiful, I think. I used to see her about
a good deal. She was always waiting. I would meet
her on the heads, in all weathers, keeping watch for
schooners. The clerk of a trading-schooner, no doubt;
but nobody knows. Waiting&ndash;&ndash;waiting&ndash;&ndash;always waiting!
Poor creature! The man didn&#8217;t come back, of
course; and then she got&ndash;&ndash;well&ndash;&ndash;flighty. Got flighty&ndash;&ndash;quite
flighty. The man didn&#8217;t come back, of course, you
know; and she had waited&ndash;&ndash;and waited&ndash;&ndash;so long, so very
long. Really, a very difficult case, brother! Something
snapped and broken&ndash;&ndash;something missing&ndash;&ndash;something
gone, you know. Poor creature! She&ndash;&ndash;she&ndash;&ndash;well,
she waited too long. Couldn&#8217;t <i>stand</i> it, you see. It
seems she loved the man&ndash;&ndash;and trusted him&ndash;&ndash;and, well,
just loved him, you know, in the way women will.
And now she&#8217;s flighty&ndash;&ndash;<i>quite</i> flighty. A difficult case,
I fear, and&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; Parson Lute interrupted. &#8220;An interesting
case. Very sad, too. And you&#8217;ve not been able to
convict her of her sin?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span></div>
<p>Parson Stump shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;No impression whatever?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, brother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How,&#8221; Parson Lute demanded, with a start, &#8220;does
she&ndash;&ndash;ah&ndash;&ndash;subsist?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She fishes, brother, in quiet weather, and she is
helped, though it is not generally known, by a picturesque
old character of the place&ndash;&ndash;a man not of the
faith, a drunkard, I fear, but kind-hearted and generous
to the needy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The woman ever converted before?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Twice, brother,&#8221; Parson Stump answered; &#8220;but
not now in a state of grace. She is quite obstinate,&#8221;
he added, &#8220;and she has, I fear, peculiar views&ndash;&ndash;<i>very</i>
peculiar, I fear&ndash;&ndash;on repentance. In fact, she loves the
child, you see; and she fears that a confession of her
sin&ndash;&ndash;a confession of repentance, you know&ndash;&ndash;might give
the world to think that her love had failed&ndash;&ndash;that she
wished the child&ndash;&ndash;well&ndash;&ndash;unborn. She would not appear
disloyal to Judith, I fear, even to save her soul. A
peculiar case, is it not? A difficult case, I fear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said Parson Lute, tapping his nose reflectively.
&#8220;The child is the obstacle. A valuable hint in
that. Well, I may be able to do something, with God&#8217;s
help.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;God bless you, brother!&#8221;</p>
<p>They shook hands....</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>My uncle was returned from Topmast Harbor. I
paused but to bid him urgently to the bedside of Elizabeth,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
then ran on to rejoin the parson at the turn of
the road. By night, in a gale of wind and rain from
the east, was no time for Parson Lute, of Yellow Tail
Tickle, to be upon the long road to Whisper Cove.
But the rough road, and the sweep of the wind, and
the steep ascents, and the dripping limbs, and the forsaken
places lying hid in the dark, and the mud and
torrents, and the knee-deep, miry puddles seemed not
to be perceived by him as he stumbled after me. He
was praying aloud&ndash;&ndash;importunately, as it is written. He
would save the soul of Elizabeth, that man; the faith, the
determination were within him. &#8217;Twas fair pitiful the
way he besought the Lord. And he made haste; he
would pause only at the crests of the hills&ndash;&ndash;to cough and
to catch his breath. I was hard driven that night&ndash;&ndash;straight
into the wind, with the breathless parson forever
at my heels. I shall never forget the exhibition of
zeal. &#8217;Twas divinely unselfish&ndash;&ndash;&#8217;twas heroic as men
have seldom shown heroism. Remembering what occurred
thereafter, I number the misguided man with
the holy martyrs. At the Cock&#8217;s Crest, whence the
road tumbled down the cliff to Whisper Cove, the wind
tore the breath out of Parson Lute, and the noise of
the breakers, and the white of the sea beyond, without
mercy, contemptuous, confused him utterly.</p>
<p>He fell.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tis near at hand, sir!&#8221; I pleaded with him.</p>
<p>He was up in a moment. &#8220;Let us press on, Daniel,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;to the salvation of that soul. Let us press on!&#8221;</p>
<p>We began the descent....</p>

<h2>XIII</h2>
<h3>JUDITH ABANDONED</h3>
</div>
<p>I left the parson in the kitchen to win back his
breath. He was near fordone, poor man! but still
entreatingly prayed, in sentences broken by consumptive
spasms, for wisdom and faith and the fire of the
Holy Ghost in this dire emergency. When I entered
the room where Elizabeth lay, &#8217;twas to the grateful discovery
that she had rallied: her breath came without
wheeze or gasp; the labored, spasmodic beating of her
heart no longer shook the bed. &#8217;Twas now as though,
I thought, they had troubled her with questions concerning
her soul or her sin; for she was turned sullen&ndash;&ndash;lying
rigid and scowling, with her eyes fixed upon the
whitewashed rafters, straying only in search of Judith,
who sat near, grieving in dry sobs, affrighted.</p>
<p>And &#8217;twas said that this Elizabeth had within the
span of my short life been a maid most lovely! There
were no traces of that beauty and sprightliness remaining.
I wondered, being a lad, that unkindness should
work a change so sad in any one. &#8217;Twas a mystery....
The room was cold. &#8217;Twas ghostly, too&ndash;&ndash;with
Death hovering there invisible. Youth is mystified
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
and appalled by the gaunt Thing. I shivered. Within,
the gale sighed and moaned and sadly whispered;
&#8217;twas blowing in a melancholy way&ndash;&ndash;foreboding some
inevitable catastrophe. Set on a low ledge of the cliff,
the cottage sagged towards the edge, as if to peer at
the breakers; and clammy little draughts stole through
the cracks of the floor and walls, crying as they came,
and crept about, searching out the uttermost corners,
with sighs and cold fingers.</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas a mean, poor place for a woman to lie in
extremity.... And she had once been lovely&ndash;&ndash;with
warm, live youth, with twinkling eyes and modesty,
with sympathy and merry ways to win the love o&#8217; folk!
Ay; but &#8217;twas wondrous hard to believe.... &#8217;Twas a
mean station of departure, indeed&ndash;&ndash;a bare, disjointed
box of a room, low-ceiled, shadowy, barren of comfort,
but yet white and neat, kept by Judith&#8217;s clever, conscientious,
loving hands. There was one small window,
outlooking to sea, black-paned in the wild night, whipped
with rain and spray. From without&ndash;&ndash;from the vastness
of sea and night&ndash;&ndash;came a confused and distant
wail, as of the lamentation of a multitude. Was this
my fancy? I do not know; but yet it seemed to me&ndash;&ndash;a
lad who listened and watched&ndash;&ndash;that a wise, pitying,
unnumbered throng lamented.</p>
<p>I could not rid my ears of this wailing....</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Elizabeth had rallied; she might weather it out,
said the five wives of Whisper Cove, who had gathered
to observe her departure.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span></div>
<p>&#8220;If,&#8221; Aunt Esther qualified, &#8220;she&#8217;s let <i>be</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Like she done las&#8217; time,&#8221; William Buttle&#8217;s wife
whispered. &#8220;I &#8217;low our watchin&#8217;s wasted. Ah, this
heart trouble! You never knows.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>If</i>,&#8221; Aunt Esther repeated, &#8220;she&#8217;s let be.&#8221;</p>
<p>We waited for the parson.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have Skipper Nicholas come?&#8221; Elizabeth asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, maid; &#8217;tis not he, maid.&#8221; They would still
taunt her! They would still taunt her, in the way of
virtuous women; &#8217;twas &#8220;Maid! Maid!&#8221; until the heart
of a man of honor&ndash;&ndash;of a man of any sort&ndash;&ndash;was fair sickened
of virtue and women. &#8220;&#8217;Tis the parson,&#8221; said
they.</p>
<p>Elizabeth sighed. &#8220;I wants a word along o&#8217; Skipper
Nicholas,&#8221; said she, faintly, &#8220;when he&#8217;ve come.&#8221;</p>
<p>Parson Lute softly entered from the kitchen, wiping
the rain from his face and hands, stepping on tiptoe
over the bare floor. He was worn and downcast. No
inspiration, it seemed, had been granted in answer to
his praying. I loved him, of old, as did all the children
of Twist Tickle, to whom he was known because of
gentlest sympathy, shown on the roads in fair weather
and foul at district-meeting time; and I was glad that
he had come to ease the passage to heaven of the
mother of Judith. The five women of Whisper Cove,
taken unaware by this stranger, stood in a flutter of
embarrassment. They were not unkind&ndash;&ndash;they were
curious concerning death and the power of parsons.
He laid a kind hand on Judith&#8217;s head, shook hands
with the women, and upon each bestowed a whispered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
blessing, being absently said; and the wives of Whisper
Cove sat down and smoothed their skirts and folded
their hands, all flushed and shaking with expectation.
They wondered, no doubt, what he would accomplish&ndash;&ndash;salvation
or not: Parson Stump had failed. Parson
Lute seemed for a moment to be unnerved by the
critical attitude of his audience&ndash;&ndash;made anxious for his
reputation: a purely professional concern, inevitably
habitual. He was not conscious of this, I am sure;
he was too kind, too earnest in service, to consider his
reputation. But yet he must <i>do</i>&ndash;&ndash;when another had
failed. The Lord had set him a hard task; but being
earnest and kind, he had no contempt, no lack of love,
I am sure, for the soul the Lord had given him to
lose or to save&ndash;&ndash;neither gross wish to excel, nor gross
wish to excuse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Daughter,&#8221; he whispered, tenderly, to Elizabeth.</p>
<p>Elizabeth threw the coverlet over her head, so that
only the tangled fringe of her hair was left to see; and
she began to laugh&ndash;&ndash;a coquettish trifling. Parson Lute
gently uncovered the head.</p>
<p>&#8220;You isn&#8217;t Parson Stump,&#8221; Elizabeth tittered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Turn your face this way,&#8221; said Parson Lute.</p>
<p>She laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;This way,&#8221; said Parson Lute.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go &#8217;way!&#8221; Elizabeth laughed. &#8220;Go on with you!&#8221;
She hid her flaming face. &#8220;You didn&#8217;t ought t&#8217; see me
in bed!&#8221; she gasped. &#8220;Go &#8217;way!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My child,&#8221; said Parson Lute, patiently, &#8220;turn your
face this way.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span></div>
<p>She would not. &#8220;Go &#8217;way!&#8221; said she.</p>
<p>&#8220;This way!&#8221; Parson Lute repeated.</p>
<p>It had been a quiet, slow command, not to go unheeded.
The five women of Whisper Cove stiffened with
amazement. Here, indeed, was a masterful parson!
Parson Stump had failed; but not this parson&ndash;&ndash;not
this parson, who could command in the name of the
Lord! They exchanged glances&ndash;&ndash;exchanged nudges.
Elizabeth&#8217;s laughter ceased. All the women of Whisper
Cove waited breathless. There was silence; the commotion
was all outside&ndash;&ndash;wind and rain and breakers,
a far-off passion, apart from the poor comedy within.
The only sound in the room was the  wheezing of the
girl on the bed. Elizabeth turned; her brows were
drawn, her eyes angry. Aunt Esther All, from her place
at the foot of the bed, heard the ominous wheeze of
her breath and observed the labor of her heart; and
she was concerned, and nudged William Buttle&#8217;s wife,
who would not heed her.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis not good for her,&#8221; Aunt Esther whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;You leave me be!&#8221; Elizabeth complained.</p>
<p>Parson Lute took her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;You quit that!&#8221; said Elizabeth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush, daughter,&#8221; the parson pleaded.</p>
<p>Into the interval of silence a gust of rain intruded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have Nicholas come?&#8221; Elizabeth asked. &#8220;Haven&#8217;t
he come yet?&#8221;</p>
<p>Aunt Esther shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wants un,&#8221; said Elizabeth, &#8220;when he&#8217;ve come.&#8221;</p>
<p>The parson began now soothingly to stroke the great,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
rough hand he held; but at once Elizabeth broke into
bashful laughter, and he dropped it&ndash;&ndash;and frowned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Woman,&#8221; he cried, in distress, &#8220;don&#8217;t you know
that you are dying?&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth&#8217;s glance ran to Judith, who rose, but sat
again, wringing her hands. The mother turned once
more to the parson; &#8217;twas an apathetic gaze, fixed upon
his restless nostrils.</p>
<p>&#8220;How is it with your soul?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas a word spoken most graciously, in the perfection
of pious desire, of reverence, of passionate concern
for the future of souls; but yet Elizabeth&#8217;s glance
moved swiftly to the parson&#8217;s eyes, in a rage, and
instantly shifted to his red hair, where it remained,
fascinated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you trusting in your Saviour&#8217;s love?&#8221;</p>
<p>I accuse myself for speaking, in this bold way, of
the unhappy question; but yet, why not? for &#8217;twas
asked in purest anxiety, in the way of Parson Lute,
whom all children loved.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you clinging,&#8221; says he, &#8220;to the Cross?&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth listlessly stared at the rafters.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you laid hold on the only Hope of escape?&#8221;</p>
<p>The child Judith&ndash;&ndash;whose grief was my same agony&ndash;&ndash;sobbed
heart-brokenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Judith!&#8221; Elizabeth called, her apathy vanished.
&#8220;Poor little Judith!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, my daughter,&#8221; the parson gently protested.
&#8220;This is not the time,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Turn your heart
away from these earthly affections,&#8221; he pleaded, his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
voice fallen to an earnest whisper. &#8220;Oh, daughter,
fix your eyes upon the Cross!&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth was sullen. &#8220;I wants Judith,&#8221; she complained.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have no time, now, my daughter, to think of
these perishing human ties.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I <i>wants</i> Judith!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mere earthly affection, daughter! &#8216;And if a
man&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; Judith,&#8221; the woman persisted, &#8220;wants <i>me</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nay,&#8221; the parson softly chided. He was kind&ndash;&ndash;patient
with her infirmity. &#8217;Twas the way of Parson
Lute. With gentleness, with a tactful humoring, he
would yet win her attention. But, &#8220;Oh,&#8221; he implored,
as though overcome by a flooding realization of the
nature and awful responsibility of his mission, &#8220;can
you not think of your soul?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Judith, dear!&#8221;</p>
<p>The child arose.</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; said the parson, quietly. &#8220;No, child!&#8221;</p>
<p>The wind shook the house to its crazy foundations
and drove the crest of a breaker against the panes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wants t&#8217; <i>tell</i> she, parson!&#8221; Elizabeth wailed. &#8220;An
I wants she&ndash;&ndash;jus&#8217; <i>wants</i> she&ndash;&ndash;anyhow&ndash;&ndash;jus&#8217; for love!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Presently, daughter; not now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&ndash;&ndash;she&#8217;s my <i>child</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Presently, daughter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Judith wept again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir!&#8221; Elizabeth gasped&ndash;&ndash;bewildered, terrified.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not now, daughter.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span></div>
<p>All the anger and complaint had gone out of Elizabeth&#8217;s
eyes; they were now filled with wonder and
apprehension. Flashes of intelligence appeared and
failed and came again. It seemed to me, who watched,
that in some desperate way, with her broken mind, she
tried to solve the mystery of this refusal. Then &#8217;twas
as though some delusion&ndash;&ndash;some terror of her benighted
state&ndash;&ndash;seized upon her: alarm changed to despair; she
rose in bed, but put her hand to her heart and fell
back.</p>
<p>&#8220;He better stop it!&#8221; Aunt Esther All muttered.</p>
<p>The four wives of Whisper Cove bitterly murmured
against her.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s savin&#8217; her soul,&#8221; said William Buttle&#8217;s wife.</p>
<p>They were interested, these wives, in the operation;
they resented disturbance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Aunt Esther retorted, &#8220;I &#8217;low, anyhow, he
don&#8217;t know much about heart-trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>Parson Lute, unconscious of this watchful observation,
frankly sighed. The hearts of men, I know,
contain no love more sweet and valuable than that
which animated his desire. He mused for an interval.
&#8220;Do you know the portion of the wicked?&#8221; he asked,
in loving-kindness, without harshness whatsoever.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>It seemed she would appease him. She was ingratiating,
now, with smile and answer. &#8220;Hell, sir,&#8221; she
answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you prepared for the change?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span></div>
<p>&#8217;Twas a familiar question, no doubt. Elizabeth&#8217;s
conversion had been diligently sought. But the lean
face of Parson Lute, and the fear of what he might
do, and the solemn quality of his voice, and his sincere
and simple desire seemed so to impress Elizabeth
that she was startled into new attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>It appeared to puzzle Parson Lute. He had been
otherwise informed by Parson Stump. The woman
was <i>not</i> in a state of grace.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have cast yourself upon the mercy of God?&#8221;
he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then how, my daughter, can you say that you are
prepared?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have made your peace with an offended God?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you say that you are prepared?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have repented of your sin?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>Parson Lute turned impatient. &#8220;And yet,&#8221; he demanded,
&#8220;you expect to go to heaven?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>What</i>!&#8221; cried Parson Lute.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Parson Lute was incredulous. &#8220;To hell?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To <i>hell</i>?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span></div>
<p>Elizabeth hesitated. By some direct and primitively
human way her benighted mind had reached its determination.
But still she hesitated&ndash;&ndash;frightened somewhat,
it may be, by the conventionality of Whisper
Cove and Twist Tickle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; said she. &#8220;Most men goes there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you,&#8221; said he, in amaze, &#8220;are not a man!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Judith&#8217;s father were,&#8221; she answered; &#8220;an&#8217; I&#8217;m
wantin&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;oh, I&#8217;m wantin&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;t&#8217; see un once again!&#8221;</p>
<p>The five wives of Whisper Cove gasped....</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The outer door was flung open. Came a rush of
wind&ndash;&ndash;the noise and wet and lusty stirring of the night.
It broke harshly in upon us; &#8217;twas a crashing discord
of might and wrath and cruel indifference&ndash;&ndash;a mocking
of this small tragedy. The door was sharply closed
against the gale. I heard the wheeze and tread of my
uncle in the kitchen. He entered&ndash;&ndash;his broad face grave
and anxious and grieved&ndash;&ndash;but instantly fled, though I
beckoned; for Parson Lute, overcome, it may be, by
the impiety of Elizabeth, was upon his knees, fervently
praying that the misguided soul might yet by some
miraculous manifestation of grace be restored to
propriety of view and of feeling. &#8217;Twas a heartfelt
prayer offered in faith, according to the enlightenment
of the man&ndash;&ndash;a confession of ignorance, a plea of human
weakness, a humble, anxious cry for divine guidance
that the woman might be plucked as a brand from the
burning, to the glory of the Lord God Most Tender and
Most High. Came, in the midst of it, a furious outburst;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
the wind rose&ndash;&ndash;achieved its utmost pitch of
power. I looked out: Whisper Cove, low between the
black barriers, was churned white; and beyond&ndash;&ndash;concealed
by the night&ndash;&ndash;the sea ran tumultuously. &#8217;Twas
a big, screaming wind, blowing in from the sea, unopposed
by tree or hill. The cottage trembled to the
gusts; the timbers complained; the lamp fluttered in
the draught. Great waves, rolling in from the open,
were broken on the rocks of Whisper Cove. Rain and
spray, driven by the gale, drummed on the roof and
rattled like hail on the window. And above this angry
clamor of wind and sea rose the wailing, importunate
prayer for the leading of the God of us all....</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>When the parson had got to his feet again, Aunt
Esther All diffidently touched his elbow. &#8220;Nicholas
have come, sir,&#8221; said she.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nicholas?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay; the man she&#8217;ve sent for.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth caught the news. &#8220;I wants un,&#8221; she
wheezed. &#8220;Go &#8217;way, parson! I wants a word along
o&#8217; Nicholas all alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ve a secret, sir,&#8221; Aunt Esther whispered.</p>
<p>Judith moved towards the door; but the parson
beckoned her back, and she stood doubtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mister Top! Mister Top!&#8221; Elizabeth called, desperate
to help herself, to whom no heed was given.</p>
<p>In the fury of the gale&ndash;&ndash;the rush past of wind and
rain&ndash;&ndash;the failing voice was lost.</p>
<p>&#8220;I &#8217;low,&#8221; Aunt Esther warned, &#8220;&#8217;twould be wise, sir&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Have the man wait in the kitchen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth lay helplessly whimpering.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, sir,&#8221; Aunt Esther protested, &#8220;she&#8217;ve&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have the man wait in the kitchen,&#8221; the parson
impatiently repeated. &#8220;There is no time now for these
worldly arrangements. No, no!&#8221; said he. &#8220;There is
no time. The woman <i>must</i> be convicted!&#8221; He was
changed: despondency had vanished&ndash;&ndash;humility gone
with it. In the eye of the man&ndash;&ndash;the gesture&ndash;&ndash;the risen
voice&ndash;&ndash;appeared some high authority to overawe us.
He had the habit of authority, as have all parsons; but
there was now some compelling, supernatural addition
to weaken us. We did not dare oppose him, not one
of us&ndash;&ndash;not my uncle, whose head had been intruded,
but was now at once withdrawn. The parson had
come out of his prayer, it seemed, refreshed and inspired;
he had remembered, it may be, that the child
was the obstacle&ndash;&ndash;the child whom Elizabeth would not
slight to save her soul. &#8220;The woman must be saved,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;She must be saved!&#8221; he cried, striking his
fist into his palm, his body all tense, his teeth snapped
shut, his voice strident. &#8220;The Lord is mighty and
merciful&ndash;&ndash;a forgiving God.&#8221; &#8217;Twas an appeal (he
looked far past the whitewashed rafters and the moving
darkness of the night); &#8217;twas a returning appeal&ndash;&ndash;a
little failure of faith, I think. &#8220;The Lord has heard
me,&#8221; he declared, doggedly. &#8220;He has not turned away.
The woman must&ndash;&ndash;she <i>shall</i>&ndash;&ndash;be saved!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, but,&#8221; Aunt Esther expostulated; &#8220;she&#8217;ve been
sort o&#8217; wantin&#8217; t&#8217; tell&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span></div>
<p>The parson&#8217;s green eyes were all at once bent in a
penetrating way upon Aunt Esther; and she backed
away, biting at her nails&ndash;&ndash;daring no further protest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Judith, my child,&#8221; said the parson, &#8220;do you go to
the kitchen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; Judith wailed. &#8220;I&#8217;m wantin&#8217; t&#8217; stay.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth stretched out her arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;It distracts your mother&#8217;s attention, you see,&#8221; said
the parson, kindly. &#8220;Do you go, my dear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I <i>will</i> not go!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Judith!&#8221; Elizabeth called.</p>
<p>The parson caught the child&#8217;s arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;You leave me be!&#8221; Judith flashed, her white little
teeth all bare.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you go,&#8221; said the parson, coldly, &#8220;to the kitchen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d better mind what he&#8217;s about!&#8221; Aunt Esther
complained.</p>
<p>Elizabeth was now on her elbow, staring in alarm.
Her breast was significantly heaving, and the great
vein of her throat had begun to beat. &#8220;Don&#8217;t send
she away, parson!&#8221; she pleaded. &#8220;She&#8217;s wantin&#8217; her
mother. Leave she be!&#8221;</p>
<p>The parson led Judith away.</p>
<p>&#8220;For God&#8217;s sake, parson,&#8221; Elizabeth gasped, &#8220;leave
she come! What you goin&#8217; t&#8217; do with she?&#8221; She made
as though to throw off the coverlet and follow; but she
was unable, and fell back in exhaustion. &#8220;Judith!&#8221;
she called. &#8220;Judith!&#8221;</p>
<p>The kitchen door was closed upon Judith; the obstacle
had been removed.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t hurt she, parson,&#8221; Elizabeth entreated, seeming,
now, to be possessed of a delusion concerning the
parson&#8217;s purpose. &#8220;She&#8217;ve done no harm, sir. She&#8217;ve
been a good child all her life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Elizabeth,&#8221; said the parson, firmly, &#8220;repent!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What you done with my Judith?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Repent!&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth&#8217;s heart began to work beyond its strength.
&#8220;For God&#8217;s sake, parson!&#8221; she gasped; &#8220;you&#8217;ll not
hurt she, will you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Repent, I say!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll repent, parson. What you goin&#8217; t&#8217; do with
Judy? Don&#8217;t hurt she, parson. I&#8217;ll repent. Oh,
bring she back, parson! I&#8217;ll repent. For God&#8217;s sake,
parson!&#8221; It may be that despair gave her cunning&ndash;&ndash;I
do not know. The deception was not beyond her:
she had been converted twice&ndash;&ndash;she was used to the
forms as practised in those days at Twist Tickle. She
wanted her child, poor woman! and her mind was
clouded with fear: she is not to be called evil for the
trick. Nor is Parson Lute to be blamed for following
earnestly all that she said&ndash;&ndash;praying, all the while, that
the issue might be her salvation. She had a calculating
eye on the face of Parson Lute. &#8220;I believe!&#8221; she cried,
watching him closely for some sign of relenting. &#8220;Help
thou my unbelief.&#8221; The parson&#8217;s face softened. &#8220;Save
me!&#8221; she whispered, exhausted. &#8220;Save my soul! I repent.
Save my soul!&#8221; She seemed now to summon all
her strength, for the parson had not yet called back the
child. &#8220;Praise God!&#8221; she screamed, seeking now beyond
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
doubt to persuade him of her salvation. &#8220;I repent!
I&#8217;m saved! I&#8217;m saved!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Praise God!&#8221; Parson Lute shouted.</p>
<p>Elizabeth swayed&ndash;&ndash;threw up her hands&ndash;&ndash;fell back
dead.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tol&#8217; you so,&#8221; said Aunt Esther, grimly.</p>

<h2>XIV</h2>
<h3>THE TWENTY-THIRD PSALM</h3>
</div>
<p>Faith, but &#8217;twas a bitter night! Men were drowning
on our coast&ndash;&ndash;going to death in the wreck of
schooners. The sea broke in unmasked assault upon
the great rocks of Whisper Cove; the gale worried the
cottage on the cliff. But &#8217;twas warm in the kitchen:
the women had kept the fire for the cup o&#8217; tea to follow
the event; &#8217;twas warm, and the lamp made light and
shadow, and the kettle bubbled and puffed, the wood
crackled, the fire snored and glowed, all serenely, in
disregard of death, as though no mystery had come
to appal the souls of us.</p>
<p>My uncle had Judith on his knee.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not able,&#8221; she sobbed.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; ye&#8217;ll not try?&#8221; he besought. &#8220;Ye&#8217;ll not even
try?&#8221;</p>
<p>We were alone: the women were employed in the
other room; the parson paced the floor, unheeding, his
yellow teeth fretting his finger-nails, his lean lips moving
in some thankful communication with the God he served.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, but!&#8221; says my uncle, &#8220;ye&#8217;ll <i>surely</i> come t&#8217; live
along o&#8217; me!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span></div>
<p>&#8220;No, no! I&#8217;ll be livin&#8217; where I&#8217;ve always lived&ndash;&ndash;with
mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye cannot live alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay; but I&#8217;m able t&#8217; live alone&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; fish alone&ndash;&ndash;like
mother done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twas not her wish, child,&#8221; says my uncle. &#8220;She&#8217;d
have ye live along o&#8217; me. &#8216;Why, Judy,&#8217; she&#8217;d have ye
know, &#8216;do ye live along o&#8217; he. Do ye trust, little maid,&#8217;
she&#8217;d have ye t&#8217; know, &#8216;that there ol&#8217; Nick Top. He&#8217;ve
a powerful bad look t&#8217; the eye in his head,&#8217; she&#8217;d say,
&#8216;an&#8217; he&#8217;ve the name o&#8217; the devil; but Lord love ye!&#8217;
she&#8217;d say, &#8216;he&#8217;ve a heart with room t&#8217; contain ye, an&#8217; a
warm welcome t&#8217; dwell within. He&#8217;ve took good care
o&#8217; little ol&#8217; Dannie,&#8217; she&#8217;d say, &#8216;an&#8217; he&#8217;ll take good care
o&#8217; <i>you</i>. He&#8217;ll never see ye hurt or wronged or misguided
so long as he lives. Not,&#8217; she&#8217;d say, &#8216;that there
damned ol&#8217; rascal!&#8217; An&#8217; if ye come, Judy, dear,&#8221; my
uncle entreated, &#8220;I won&#8217;t see ye wronged&ndash;&ndash;I won&#8217;t!&#8221;
My uncle&#8217;s little eyes were overrunning now&ndash;&ndash;the little
eyes he would not look into. The parson still paced
the floor, still unheeding, still muttering fervent prayer
of some strange sort; but my uncle, aged in sinful ways,
was frankly crying. &#8220;Ye&#8217;ll come, Judy, will ye not?&#8221;
he begged. &#8220;Along o&#8217; ol&#8217; Nick Top, who would not
see ye wronged? Ah, little girl!&#8221; he implored&ndash;&ndash;and
then her head fell against him&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;ye&#8217;ll surely never
doubt Nick Top. An&#8217; ye&#8217;ll come t&#8217; he, an&#8217; ye&#8217;ll sort
o&#8217; look after un, will ye not?&ndash;&ndash;that poor ol&#8217; feller!&#8221;</p>
<p>Judith was sobbing on his breast.</p>
<p>&#8220;That poor, poor ol&#8217; feller!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span></div>
<p>She wept the more bitterly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor little girl!&#8221; he crooned, patting her shoulder.
&#8220;Ah, the poor little girl!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go!&#8221; cried Judith, in a passion of woe and
gratitude. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; trust an&#8217; love an&#8217; care for
you!&#8221;</p>
<p>My uncle clasped her close. &#8220;&#8216;<i>The Lard is my
shepherd,</i>&#8217;&#8221; says he, looking up, God knows to what!
his eyes streaming, &#8220;&#8216;<i>I shall not want. He maketh
me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside
the still waters.</i>&#8217;&#8221; By the wind, by the breaking of
the troubled sea, the old man&#8217;s voice was obscured.
&#8220;&#8216;<i>Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow
of death, I will fear no evil; for thou art with me: thy
rod and thy staff they comfort me.</i>&#8217;&#8221; Judith still sobbed,
uncomforted; my uncle stroked her hair&ndash;&ndash;and again
she broke into passionate weeping. &#8220;&#8216;<i>Thou preparest
a table before me in the presence of my enemies: thou
anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.</i>&#8217;&#8221;
Returned, again, in a lull of the gale, my fancy that I
caught the lamentation of a multitude. &#8220;&#8216;<i>Surely goodness
and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life:
and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.</i>&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bless God!&#8221; cried the parson. &#8220;Bless God,
brother!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; said my uncle, feelingly, &#8220;bless God!&#8221;</p>
<p>The parson wrung my uncle&#8217;s hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;That there psa&#8217;m don&#8217;t seem true, parson, b&#8217;y,&#8221;
says my uncle, &#8220;on a night like this here dirty night,
with schooners in trouble at sea. Ever been t&#8217; sea in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
a gale o&#8217; wind, parson? Ah, well! it don&#8217;t seem true&ndash;&ndash;not
in a gale o&#8217; wind, with this here poor, lonely little
maid&#8217;s mother lyin&#8217; there dead in the nex&#8217; room. It
jus&#8217; don&#8217;t seem true!&#8221;</p>
<p>Parson Lute, poor man! started&ndash;&ndash;stared, pained,
anxious; in doubt, it may be, of the Christian congeniality
of this man.</p>
<p>&#8220;It don&#8217;t seem true,&#8221; says my uncle, &#8220;in the face of
a easterly gale an&#8217; the death o&#8217; mothers. An&#8217;, look you,
parson,&#8221; he declared, &#8220;I&#8217;ll be&ndash;&ndash;well, parson, I&#8217;ll jus&#8217; be
<i>jiggered</i>&ndash;&ndash;if it do! There you haves it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; the parson answered, accusingly, &#8220;it is
in the Bible; it must be true.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis <i>where</i>?&#8221; my uncle demanded, confounded.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the Bible, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; it&ndash;&ndash;it&ndash;&ndash;must be&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;True, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>My uncle sighed; and&ndash;&ndash;for I know his loving-kindness&ndash;&ndash;&#8217;twas
a sigh that spoke a pain at heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;It must be true,&#8221; reiterated the wretched parson,
now, it seemed, beset by doubt. &#8220;It <i>must</i> be
true!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, by the dear God ye serve, parson!&#8221; roared
my uncle, with healthy spirit, superior in faith, &#8220;I
<i>knows</i> &#8217;tis true, Bible or St. John&#8217;s noospaper!&#8221;</p>
<p>Aunt Esther put her gray head in at the door. &#8220;Is
the kettle b&#8217;ilin&#8217;?&#8221; says she.</p>
<p>The kettle was boiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; says she&ndash;&ndash;and disappeared.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;<i>Though I walk,</i>&#8217;&#8221; the parson repeated, his thin,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
freckled hands clasped, &#8220;&#8216;<i>through the valley of the
shadow of death!</i>&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no doctor at Twist Tickle: so the parson
lay dead&ndash;&ndash;poor man!&ndash;&ndash;of the exposure of that night,
within three days, in the house of Parson Stump....</p>

<h3>A MEASURE OF PRECAUTION</h3>
</div>
<p>With the threats of the gray stranger in mind, my
uncle now began without delay to refit the <i>Shining
Light</i>: this for all the world as though &#8217;twere a timely
and reasonable thing to do. But &#8217;twas neither timely,
for the fish were running beyond expectation off Twist
Tickle, nor reasonable, for the <i>Shining Light</i> had
been left to rot and foul in the water of Old Wives&#8217;
Cove since my infancy. Whatever the pretence he
made, the labor was planned and undertaken in anxious
haste: there was, indeed, too much pretence&ndash;&ndash;too
suave an explanation, a hand too aimless and unsteady,
an eye too blank, too large a flow of liquor&ndash;&ndash;for
a man who suffered no secret perturbation.</p>
<p>&#8220;In case o&#8217; accident, Dannie,&#8221; he explained, as though
&#8217;twere a thing of no importance. &#8220;Jus&#8217; in case o&#8217; accident.
I wouldn&#8217;t be upset,&#8221; says he, &#8220;an I was you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never you fear,&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; says he; &#8220;you&#8217;ll stand by, Dannie!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That I will,&#8221; I boasted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye can&#8217;t delude <i>me</i>,&#8221; says he. &#8220;I knows <i>you</i>. I
bet ye <i>you&#8217;ll</i> stand by, whatever comes of it.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span></div>
<p>&#8217;Tis quite beyond me to express my gratification.
&#8217;Twas a mysterious business altogether&ndash;&ndash;this whim to
make the <i>Shining Light</i> ready for sea. I could make
nothing of it at all. And why, thinks I, should the old
craft all at once be troubled by all this pother of block
and tackle and hammer and saw? &#8217;Twas beyond me to
fathom; but I was glad to discover, whatever the puzzle,
that my uncle&#8217;s faith in the lad he had nourished was
got real and large. &#8217;Twas not for that he bred me; but
&#8217;twas the only reward&ndash;&ndash;and that a mean, poor one&ndash;&ndash;he
might have. And he was now come near, it seemed,
to dependence upon me; there was that in his voice to
show it&ndash;&ndash;a little trembling, a little hopelessness, a little
wistfulness: a little weakening of its quality of wrathful
courage.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>You&#8217;ll</i> stand by,&#8221; he had said; and, ay, but it fair
saddened me to feel the appeal of his aging spirit to
my growing years! There comes a time, no doubt, in
the relationship of old and young, when the guardian
is all at once changed into the cherished one. &#8217;Tis a
tragical thing&ndash;&ndash;a thing to be resolved, to be made merciful
and benign, only by the acquiescence of the failing
spirit. There is then no interruption&ndash;&ndash;no ripple upon
the flowing river of our lives. As for my uncle, I fancy
that he kept watch upon me, in those days, to read his
future, to discover his achievement, in my disposition.
Stand by? Ay, that I would! And being young I
sought a deed to do: I wished the accident might befall
to prove me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Accident?&#8221; cries I. &#8220;Never you fear!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not fear,&#8221; says he, &#8220;that ye&#8217;ll not stand by.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; I complained; &#8220;but never you fear at all!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not fear,&#8221; he repeated, with a little twinkle of
amusement, &#8220;that ye&#8217;ll not stand by, as best ye&#8217;re
able.&#8221;</p>
<p>I felt now my strength&ndash;&ndash;the greatness of my body
and the soaring courage of my soul. This in the innocent
way of a lad; and by grace of your recollection I
shall not be blamed for it. Fourteen and something
more? &#8217;Twas a mighty age! What did it lack, thinks
I, of power and wisdom? To be sure I strutted the
present most haughtily and eyed the future with as
saucy a flash as lads may give. The thing delighted my
uncle; he would chuckle and clap me on the back and
cry, &#8220;That&#8217;s very good!&#8221; until I was wrought into a
mood of defiance quite ridiculous. But still &#8217;tis rather
grateful to recall: for what&#8217;s a lad&#8217;s boasting but the
honest courage of a man? I would serve my uncle;
but &#8217;twas not all: I would serve Judith. She was now
come into our care: I would serve her.</p>
<p>&#8220;They won&#8217;t nothin&#8217; hurt <i>she</i>!&#8221; thinks I.</p>
<p>I am glad to recall that this boyish love took a turn
so chivalrous....</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>When &#8217;twas noised abroad that my uncle was to
refit the <i>Shining Light</i>, Twist Tickle grew hilarious.
&#8220;Laugh an you will, lads,&#8221; says my uncle, then about
the business of distributing genial invitations to the
hauling-down. &#8220;&#8217;Tis a gift o&#8217; the good Lord t&#8217; be able
t&#8217; do it. The ol&#8217; girl out there haven&#8217;t a wonderful lot
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
to admire, an&#8217; she&#8217;s nowhere near t&#8217; windward o&#8217; forty;
but I&#8217;ll show ye, afore I&#8217;m through, that she&#8217;ll stand by
in a dirty blow, an I jus&#8217; asks she t&#8217; try. Ye&#8217;ll find,
lads,&#8221; says he, &#8220;when ye&#8217;re so old as me, an&#8217; sailed t&#8217;
foreign parts, that they&#8217;s more to a old maid or a water-side
widow than t&#8217; many a lass o&#8217; eighteen. The ol&#8217;
girl out there haves a mean allowance o&#8217; beauty, but
she&#8217;ve a character that isn&#8217;t talked about after dark;
an&#8217; when I buys her a pair o&#8217; shoes an&#8217; a new gown,
why, ecod! lads, ye&#8217;ll think she&#8217;s a lady. &#8217;Tis one way,&#8221;
says he, &#8220;that ladies is <i>made</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>This occurred at Eli Flack&#8217;s stage of an evening when
a mean, small catch was split and the men-folk were
gathered for gossip. &#8217;Twas after sunset, with fog drifting
in on a lazy wind: a glow of red in the west. Our
folk were waiting for the bait-skiff, which had long been
gone for caplin, skippered, this time, by the fool of
Twist Tickle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever,&#8221; says my uncle, &#8220;they&#8217;ll be a darn o&#8217;
rum for ye, saved and unsaved, when she&#8217;ve been
hauled down an&#8217; scraped. An&#8217; will ye come t&#8217; the
haulin&#8217;-down?&#8221;</p>
<p>That they would!</p>
<p>&#8220;I knowed ye would,&#8221; says my uncle, as he stumped
away, &#8220;saved an&#8217; unsaved.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bait-skiff conch-horn sounded. The boat had
entered the narrows. &#8217;Twas coming slowly through the
quiet evening&ndash;&ndash;laden with bait for the fishing of to-morrow.
Again the horn&ndash;&ndash;echoing sweetly, faintly,
among the hills of Twin Islands. &#8217;Twas Moses Shoos
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
that blew; there was no mistaking the long-drawn
blast.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Ah, well! she needed the grooming, this <i>Shining
Light</i>, whatever the occasion. &#8217;Twas scandalous to
observe her decay in idleness. She needed the grooming&ndash;&ndash;this
neglected, listless, slatternly old maid of a
craft. A craft of parts, to be sure, as I had been told;
but a craft left to slow wreck, at anchor in quiet water.
Year by year, since I could remember the days of my
life, in summer and winter weather she had swung with
the tides or rested silent in the arms of the ice. I had
come to Twist Tickle aboard, as the tale of my infancy
ran, on the wings of a nor&#8217;east gale of some pretensions;
and she had with heroic courage weathered a dirty blow
to land me upon the eternal rocks of Twin Islands. For
this&ndash;&ndash;though but an ancient story, told by old folk to
engage my presence in the punts and stages of our
harbor&ndash;&ndash;I loved her, as a man, Newfoundland born and
bred, may with propriety love a ship.</p>
<p>There are maids to be loved, no doubt, and &#8217;tis very
nice to love them, because they are maids, fashioned in
a form most lovely by the good Lord, given a heart most
childlike and true and loving and tenderly dependent,
so that, in all the world, as I know, there is nothing so
to be cherished with a man&#8217;s last breath as a maid. I
have loved a maid and speak with authority. But there
is also a love of ships, though, being inland-born, you
may not know it. &#8217;Tis a surpassing faith and affection,
inspired neither by beauty nor virtue, but wilful and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
mysterious, like the love of a maid. &#8217;Tis much the
same, I&#8217;m thinking: forgiving to the uttermost, prejudiced
beyond the perception of any fault, savagely loyal.
&#8217;Twas in this way, at any rate, that my uncle regarded
the <i>Shining Light</i>; and &#8217;twas in this way, too, with some
gentler shades of admiration, proceeding from an apt
imagination, that I held the old craft in esteem.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dannie,&#8221; says my uncle, presently, as we walked
homeward, &#8220;ye&#8217;ll &#8217;blige me, lad, by keepin&#8217; a eye on
the mail-boat.&#8221;</p>
<p>I wondered why.</p>
<p>&#8220;You keep a eye,&#8221; he whispered, winking in a way
most grave and troubled, &#8220;on that there little mail-boat
when she lands her passengers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For what?&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Brass buttons,&#8221; says he.</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas now that the cat came out of the bag. Brass
buttons? &#8217;Twas the same as saying constables. This
extraordinary undertaking was then a precaution against
the accident of arrest. &#8217;Twas inspired, no doubt, by the
temper of that gray visitor with whom my uncle had
dealt over the table in a fashion so surprising. I wondered
again concerning that amazing broil, but to no
purpose; &#8217;twas &#8217;beyond my wisdom and ingenuity to
involve these opposite natures in a crime that might
make each tolerable to the other and advantage them
both. &#8217;Twas plain, at any rate, that my uncle stood
in jeopardy, and that of no trivial sort: else never would
he have employed his scant savings upon the hull of the
<i>Shining Light</i>. It grieved me to know it. &#8217;Twas most
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
sad and most perplexing. &#8217;Twas most aggravating, too:
for I must put no questions, but accept, in cheerful
serenity, the revelations he would indulge me with, and
be content with that.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; if ye sees so much as a single brass button comin&#8217;
ashore,&#8221; says he, &#8220;ye&#8217;ll give me a hail, will ye not, whereever
I is?&#8221;</p>
<p>This I would do.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye never can tell,&#8221; he added, sadly, &#8220;what&#8217;s in the
wind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m never allowed t&#8217; know,&#8221; said I.</p>
<p>He was quick to catch the complaint. &#8220;Ye&#8217;re growin&#8217;
up, Dannie,&#8221; he observed; &#8220;isn&#8217;t you, lad?&#8221;</p>
<p>I fancied I was already grown.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, well!&#8221; says he; &#8220;they&#8217;ll come a time, lad, God
help ye! when ye&#8217;ll know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wisht &#8217;twould hasten,&#8221; said I.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wisht &#8217;twould never come at all,&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas disquieting....</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Work on the <i>Shining Light</i> went forward apace and
with right good effect. &#8217;Twas not long&ndash;&ndash;it might be a
fortnight&ndash;&ndash;before her hull was as sound as rotten plank
could be made with gingerly calking. &#8217;Twas indeed
a delicate task to tap the timbers of her: my uncle must
sometimes pause for anxious debate upon the wisdom
of venturing a stout blow. But copper-painted below
the water-line, adorned above, she made a brave showing
at anchor, whatever she might do at sea; and there
was nothing for it, as my uncle said, but to have faith,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
which would do well enough: for faith, says he, could
move mountains. When she had been gone over fore
and aft, aloft and below, in my uncle&#8217;s painstaking way&ndash;&ndash;when
she had been pumped and ballasted and cleared
of litter and swabbed down and fitted with a new suit
of sails&ndash;&ndash;she so won upon our confidence that not one
of us who dwelt on the neck of land by the Lost Soul
would have feared to adventure anywhere aboard.</p>
<p>The fool of Twist Tickle pulled a long face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hut, Moses!&#8221; I maintained; &#8220;she&#8217;ll do very well.
Jus&#8217; look at her!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother always &#8217;lowed,&#8221; says he, &#8220;that a craft was
like a woman. An&#8217; since mother died, I&#8217;ve come t&#8217;
learn for myself, Dannie,&#8221; he drawled, &#8220;that the more
a woman haves in the way o&#8217; looks the less weather
she&#8217;ll stand. I&#8217;ve jus&#8217; come, now,&#8221; says he, &#8220;from
overhaulin&#8217; a likely maid at Chain Tickle.&#8221;</p>
<p>I looked up with interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jinny Lawless,&#8221; says he. &#8220;Ol&#8217; Skipper Garge&#8217;s
youngest by the third.&#8221;</p>
<p>My glance was still inquiring.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, Dannie,&#8221; he sighed; &#8220;she&#8217;ve declined.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve took a look,&#8221; I inquired, &#8220;at the maids o&#8217;
Long Bill Hodge o&#8217; Sampson&#8217;s Island?&#8221;</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; they&#8217;ve&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>All</i> declined,&#8221; says he.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never you care, Moses,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Looks or no
looks, you&#8217;ll find the <i>Shining Light</i> stand by when <i>she</i>
puts to sea.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not be aboard,&#8221; says he.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not so sure about that!&#8221; quoth I.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t ship,&#8221; he drawled. &#8220;I&#8217;d never put t&#8217;
sea on she: for mother,&#8221; he added, &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t like t&#8217;
run the risk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You dwell too much upon your mother,&#8221; said I.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s all I got in the way o&#8217; women,&#8221; he answered.
&#8220;All I got, Dannie&ndash;&ndash;yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But when you gets a wife&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; he interrupted, &#8220;Mrs. Moses Shoos won&#8217;t
mind <i>mother</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Still an&#8217; all,&#8221; I gravely warned him, &#8220;&#8217;tis a foolish
thing t&#8217; do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Dannie,&#8221; he drawled, in a way so plaintive
that I found no answer to his argument, &#8220;I <i>is</i> a fool.
I&#8217;m told so every day, by men an&#8217; maids, wherever I
goes; an&#8217; I jus&#8217; can&#8217;t help <i>bein&#8217;</i> foolish.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;God made you,&#8221; said I.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; mother always &#8217;lowed,&#8221; said Moses, &#8220;that He
knowed what He was up to. An&#8217;, Dannie,&#8221; says he,
&#8220;she always &#8217;lowed, anyhow, that <i>she</i> was satisfied.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas of a Sunday evening&ndash;&ndash;upon the verge of twilight:
with the light of day still abroad, leaving the
hills of Twin Islands clear-cut against the blue sky,
but falling aslant, casting long shadows. Came, then,
straggling from the graveyard in the valley by Thunder
Head, the folk of our harbor. &#8217;Twas all over, it seemed;
they had buried old Tom Hossie. Moses and I sat
together on the hill by Old Wives&#8217; Cove, in the calm of
the day and weather: there was no wind stirring&ndash;&ndash;no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
drip of oar to be heard, no noise of hammer, no laughter
of children, no cry or call of labor. They had buried
old Tom Hossie, whom no peril of that coast, savagely
continuing through seventy years, had overcome or
daunted, but age had gently drawn away. I had
watched them bear the coffin by winding paths along
the Tickle shore and up the hill, stopping here to rest
and there to rest, for the way was long; and now, sitting
in the yellow sunshine of that kind day, with the fool of
Twist Tickle for company, I watched them come again,
their burden deposited in the inevitable arms. I wondered
if the spirit of old Tom Hossie rejoiced in its escape.
I wondered if it continued in pitiable age or had returned
to youth&ndash;&ndash;to strength for action and wish for love. I
wondered, with the passionate curiosity of a lad, as I
watched the procession of simple folk disperse, far off,
to supper and to the kisses of children, if the spirit of
old Tom Hossie had rather sail the seas he had sailed
and love the maids of our land or dwell in the brightest
glory painted for us by the prophets. I could, then,
being a lad, conceive no happier world than that in
which I moved, no joy aside from its people and sea
and sunlight, no rest apart from the mortal love of
Judith; but, now, grown older, I fancy that the spirit
of old Tom Hossie, wise with age and vastly weary of
the labor and troublous delights of life, hungered and
thirsted for death.</p>
<p>The church bell broke upon this morbid meditation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hark!&#8221; says Moses. &#8220;&#8217;Tis the first bell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas a melodious call to worship&ndash;&ndash;throbbing sweetly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
across the placid water of our harbor, beating on, liquidly
vibrant, to rouse the resting hills of Twin Islands.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be off, Moses?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; says he; &#8220;for mother always &#8217;lowed &#8217;twas good
for a man t&#8217; go t&#8217; church, an&#8217; I couldn&#8217;t do nothin&#8217;,
Dannie, that mother wouldn&#8217;t like. I seem, lad, t&#8217; hear
her callin&#8217;, in that bell. &#8216;Come&ndash;&ndash;dear!&#8217; says she, &#8216;Come&ndash;&ndash;dear!
Come&ndash;&ndash;dear!&#8217; Tis like she used t&#8217; call me
from the door. &#8216;Come, dear,&#8217; says she; &#8216;you&#8217;ll never
be hurt,&#8217; says she, &#8216;when you&#8217;re within with me.&#8217; So
I &#8217;low I&#8217;ll go t&#8217; church, Dannie, where mother would
have me be. &#8216;You don&#8217;t <i>need</i> t&#8217; leave the parson scare
you, Moses,&#8217; says she; &#8216;all you got t&#8217; do, dear,&#8217; says she,
&#8216;is t&#8217; remember that your mother loves you. You&#8217;re so
easy to scare, poor lad!&#8217; says she; &#8216;but never forget
<i>that</i>&#8217; says she, &#8216;an&#8217; you&#8217;ll never be feared o&#8217; God. In
fair weather,&#8217; says she, &#8216;a man may need no Hand t&#8217;
guide un; but in times o&#8217; trouble,&#8217; says she, &#8216;he&#8217;ve jus&#8217;
got t&#8217; have a God. I found that out,&#8217; says she, &#8216;jus&#8217;
afore you was born an&#8217; jus&#8217; after I knowed you was a
fool. So I &#8217;low, Moses,&#8217; says she, &#8216;you&#8217;d best go t&#8217;
church an&#8217; make friends with God, for then,&#8217; says she,
&#8216;you&#8217;ll not feel mean t&#8217; call upon Him when the evil
days comes. In times o&#8217; trouble,&#8217; says mother, &#8216;a man
jus&#8217; can&#8217;t help singin&#8217; out for aid. An&#8217; &#8217;tis a mean, poor
man,&#8217; says she, &#8216;that goes beggin&#8217; to a Stranger.&#8217; Hark
t&#8217; the bell, Dannie! Does you not hear it? Does you
not hear it call the folk t&#8217; come?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas still ringing its tender invitation.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis jus&#8217; like the voice o&#8217; mother,&#8221; said the fool of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
Twist Tickle. &#8220;Like when she used t&#8217; call me from
the door. &#8216;Come, dear!&#8217; says she. Hark, Dannie!
Hear her voice? &#8216;Come&ndash;&ndash;dear! Come&ndash;&ndash;dear! Come&ndash;&ndash;dear!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>God help me! but I heard no voice....</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Well, now, my uncle was in no genial humor while
the work on the <i>Shining Light</i> was under way: for from
our house, at twilight, when he paced the gravelled path,
he could spy the punts come in from the grounds, gunwale
laden, every one. &#8217;Twas a poor lookout, said he,
for a man with thirty quintal in his stage and the season
passing; and he would, by lamplight, with many sighs
and much impatient fuming, overhaul his accounts, as
he said. &#8217;Tis a mystery to me to this day how he managed
it. I&#8217;ve no inkling of the system&ndash;&ndash;nor capacity to
guess it out. &#8217;Twas all done with six round tin boxes
and many sorts of shot; and he would drop a shot here
and drop a shot there, and empty a box and fill one, and
withdraw shot from the bags to drop in the boxes, and
pick shot from the boxes to stow away in the bags, all
being done in noisy exasperation, which would give way,
presently, to despair, whereupon he would revive, drop
shot with renewed vigor, counting aloud, the while, upon
his seven fingers, until, in the end, he would come out
of the engagement grimly triumphant. When, however,
the <i>Shining Light</i> was ready for sea, with but an anchor
to ship for flight, he cast his accounts for the last time,
and returned to his accustomed composure and gentle
manner with us all.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span></div>
<p>I lingered with him over his liquor that night; and I
marked, when I moved his lamp near, that he was older
than he had been.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re all wore out, sir,&#8221; said I.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Dannie,&#8221; he answered; &#8220;but I&#8217;m troubled.&#8221;</p>
<p>I put his glass within reach. For a long time he disregarded
it: but sat disconsolate, staring vacantly at the
floor, fallen into some hopeless muse. I turned away;
and in a moment, when I looked again, I found his eyes
bent upon me, as if in anxious appraisement of my
quality.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye <i>will</i> stand by,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;will ye not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will!&#8221; I swore, in instant response.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever comes t&#8217; your knowledge?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever comes!&#8221;</p>
<p>He held his glass aloft&ndash;&ndash;laughed in delighted defiance&ndash;&ndash;tossed
off the liquor. &#8220;Ecod!&#8221; cries he, most heartily;
&#8220;&#8217;tis you an&#8217; me, ol&#8217; shipmate, ag&#8217;in the world!
Twelve year ago,&#8221; says he, &#8220;since you an&#8217; me got under
way on this here little cruise in the <i>Shining Light</i>.
&#8217;Twas you an&#8217; me then. &#8217;Tis you an&#8217; me now. &#8217;Twill
be you an&#8217; me t&#8217; the end o&#8217; the v&#8217;y&#8217;ge. Here&#8217;s t&#8217; fair
winds or foul! Here&#8217;s t&#8217; the ship an&#8217; the crew! Here&#8217;s
t&#8217; you an&#8217; here&#8217;s t&#8217; me! Here&#8217;s t&#8217; harbor for our souls!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas inspiring. I had never known the like to come
from my uncle. &#8217;Twas a thrilling toast. I wished I
had a glass.</p>
<p>&#8220;For it may be, lad,&#8221; says my uncle, &#8220;that we&#8217;ll
have t&#8217; put t&#8217; sea!&#8221;</p>
<p>But for many a month thereafter the <i>Shining Light</i>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
lay at anchor where then she swung. No brass buttons
came ashore from the mail-boat: no gray stranger intruded
upon our peace. Life flowed quietly in new
courses: in new courses, to be sure, with Judith and
John Cather come into our house, but still serenely, as
of old. The <i>Shining Light</i> rose and fell, day by day,
with the tides of that summer, kept ready for our flight.
In the end, she put to sea; but &#8217;twas not in the way my
uncle had foreseen. &#8217;Twas not in flight; &#8217;twas in pursuit.
&#8217;Twas a thing infinitely more anxious and momentous.
&#8217;Twas a thing that meant much more than
life or death. In these distant days&ndash;&ndash;from my chair,
here, in our old house&ndash;&ndash;by the window of my room&ndash;&ndash;I
look out upon the water of Old Wives&#8217; Cove, whence the
<i>Shining Light</i> has for many years been missing; and I
remember the time she slipped her anchor and ran to
sea with the night coming down and a gale of wind
blowing lustily up from the gray northeast.</p>

<h3>GREEN PASTURES: AN INTERLUDE</h3>
</div>
<p>In all this time Judith dwelt with us by the Lost Soul.
When my uncle fetched her from Whisper Cove, he
gravely gave her into the care of our maid-servant, long
ago widowed by the sea, who had gone childless all her
life, and was now come to the desolate years, when she
would sit alone and wistful at twilight, staring out into
the empty world, where only hopelessly deepening
shadows were, until &#8217;twas long past time to light the
lamp. In the child that was I she had found no ease
or recompense, because of the mystery concerning me,
which in its implication of wickedness revolted her, and
because of my uncle&#8217;s regulation of her demeanor in my
presence, which tolerated no affectionate display; but
when Judith came, orphaned and ill-nourished, the
woman sat no longer in moods at evening, but busied
herself in motherly service of the child, reawakened in
the spirit. &#8217;Twas thus to a watchful, willing guardianship,
most tenderly maternal in solicitude and self-sacrifice,
that Judith was brought by wise old Nick Top of
Twist Tickle.</p>
<p>My uncle would have no misunderstanding.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Nick,&#8221; says I, &#8220;you&#8217;ll be havin&#8217; a chair set
for Judy in the cabin?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, lad,&#8221; he answered; &#8220;not for little Judy.&#8221;</p>
<p>I expostulated most vigorously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dannie, lad,&#8221; said he, with a gravity that left me
no stomach for argument, &#8220;the maid goes steerage
along o&#8217; me. This here little matter o&#8217; Judy,&#8221; he added,
gently, &#8220;belongs t&#8217; me. I&#8217;m not makin&#8217; a lady o&#8217; she.
She haves nothin&#8217; t&#8217; do&ndash;&ndash;nothin&#8217; t&#8217; do, thank God!&ndash;&ndash;with
what&#8217;s gone afore.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no word to say.</p>
<p>&#8220;An ye&#8217;re wantin&#8217; t&#8217; have Judy t&#8217; dinner, by times,&#8221;
he continued, winking a genial understanding of my
love-lorn condition, &#8220;I &#8217;low it might be managed by
a clever hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>I asked him the way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Slug-shot,&#8221; says he.</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas the merest hint.</p>
<p>&#8220;Remove,&#8221; says he, darkly, &#8220;one slug-shot from the
box with the star, an&#8217; drop it,&#8221; says he, his left eye
closed again, &#8220;in the box with the cross.&#8221;</p>
<p>And there I had it!</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>You must know that by my uncle&#8217;s severe direction
I must never fail to appear at table in the evening save
in the perfection of cleanliness as to face and hands and
nails and teeth. &#8220;For what,&#8221; says he, &#8220;have Skipper
Chesterfield t&#8217; say on that p&#8217;int&ndash;&ndash;underlined by Sir
Harry? Volume II., page 24. A list o&#8217; the ornamental
accomplishments. &#8216;<i>T&#8217; be extremely clean in your person.</i>&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
There you haves it&ndash;&ndash;underlined by Sir Harry!&#8221;
He would examine me keenly, every nail and tooth of
me, accepting neither excuse nor apology, and would
never sit with me until I had passed inspection. In the
beginning, &#8217;twas my uncle&#8217;s hand, laid upon me in
virtuous chastisement, that persuaded me of the propriety
of this genteel conduct; but presently, when I
was grown used to the thing, &#8217;twas fair impossible for
me to approach the meat, in times of peace with place
and weather, confronting no peril, hardship, laborious
need, or discomfort, before this particular ornamental
accomplishment had been indubitably achieved with
satisfaction to my uncle and to myself.</p>
<p>My uncle had, moreover, righteously compelled, with
precisely similar tactics as to the employment of his
right hand, an attire in harmony with the cleanliness
of my person. &#8220;For what,&#8221; says he, &#8220;have bully ol&#8217;
Skipper Chesterfield t&#8217; say on that there little p&#8217;int?
What have that there fashionable ol&#8217; gentleman t&#8217; hold&ndash;&ndash;underlined
by Sir Harry? Volume II, page 24. &#8216;A
list o&#8217; the ornamental accomplishments (without which
no man livin&#8217; can either please or rise in the world),
which hitherto I fear ye wants,&#8217;&#8221; quotes he, most glibly,
&#8220;&#8216;an&#8217; which only require your care an&#8217; attention t&#8217; possess.&#8217;
Volume II., page 24. &#8216;<i>An&#8217; perfeckly well dressed,
accordin&#8217; t&#8217; the fashion, be that what it will.</i>&#8217; There
you haves it,&#8221; says he, &#8220;an&#8217; underlined by Sir Harry
hisself!&#8221; &#8217;Twas a boresome thing, to be sure, as a
lad of eleven, to come from boyish occupations to this
maidenly concern for appearances: but now, when I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
am grown older, &#8217;tis a delight to escape the sweat and
uniform of the day&#8217;s work; and I am grateful to the
broad hand that scorched my childish parts to teach
me the value and pleasures of gentility.</p>
<p>At the same time, as you may believe, I was taught
a manner of entering, in the way, by the hints of Sir
Harry and the philosophy of the noble Lord Chesterfield,
of a gentleman. It had to do with squared shoulders,
the lift of the head, a strut, a proud and contemptuous
glance. Many a night, as a child, when I fair
fainted of vacancy and the steam and smell of salt pork
was an agony hardly to be endured, I must prance in
and out, to please my fastidious uncle, while he sat
critical by the fire&ndash;&ndash;in the unspeakable detachment of
critics from the pressing needs (for example) of a man&#8217;s
stomach&ndash;&ndash;and indulged his artistic perceptions to their
completest satisfaction. He would watch me from his
easy-chair by the fire as though &#8217;twere the most delectable
occupation the mind of man might devise: leaning
forward in absorption, his ailing timber comfortably
bestowed, his great head cocked, like a canary-bird&#8217;s,
his little eyes watchful and sparkling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once again, Dannie,&#8221; says he. &#8220;Head throwed
higher, lad. An&#8217; ye might use yer chest a bit more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Into the hall and back again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fair,&#8221; says he. &#8220;I&#8217;ll not deny that ye&#8217;re doin&#8217;
better. But Sir Harry, lad,&#8221; says he, concerned, with a
rub at his weathered nose, &#8220;uses more chest. Head
high, lad; shoulders back, chest out. Come now! An&#8217;
a mite more chest.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span></div>
<p>This time at a large swagger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very good,&#8221; says he, in a qualified way. &#8220;But
could ye not scowl t&#8217; more purpose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas fair heroic to indulge him&ndash;&ndash;with the room full
of the smell of browned meat. But, says I, desperately,
&#8220;I&#8217;ll try, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jus&#8217; you think, Dannie,&#8221; says he, &#8220;that that there
ol&#8217; rockin&#8217;-chair with the tidy is a belted knight o&#8217; the
realm. Come now! Leave me see how ye&#8217;d deal with
<i>he</i>. An&#8217; a mite more chest, Dannie, if ye&#8217;re able.&#8221;</p>
<p>A withering stare for the rocking-chair&ndash;&ndash;superior to
the point of impudence&ndash;&ndash;and a blank look for the unfortunate
assemblage of furniture.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; cries my uncle. &#8220;Ecod! but I never knowed
Sir Harry t&#8217; do it better. That there belted rockin&#8217;-chair
o&#8217; the realm, Dannie, would swear you was a
lord! An&#8217; now, lad,&#8221; says he, fondly smiling, &#8220;ye may
feed.&#8221;<a name='FNanchor_0005' id='FNanchor_0005'></a><a href='#Footnote_0005' class='fnanchor'>[5]</a></p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span></div>
<p>This watchful cultivation, continuing through years,
had flowered in a pretty swagger, as you may well believe.
In all my progress to this day I have not observed
a more genteelly insolent carriage than that
which memory gives to the lad that was I. I have now
no regret: for when I am abroad, at times, for the
health and pleasure of us all, &#8217;tis a not ungrateful thing,
not unamusing, to be reminded, by the deferential service
and regard this ill-suited manner wins for the outport
man that I am, of those days when my fond uncle
taught me to scowl and strut and cry, &#8220;What the devil
d&#8217;ye mean, sir!&#8221; to impress my quality upon the saucy
world. But when Judith came into our care&ndash;&ndash;when
first she sat with us at table, crushed, as a blossom, by
the Hand that seems unkind: shy, tender-spirited, alien
to our ways&ndash;&ndash;&#8217;twas with a tragical shock I realized the
appearance of high station my uncle&#8217;s misguided effort
and affection had stamped me with.</p>
<p>She sat with my uncle in the steerage; and she was
lovely, very gentle and lovely, I recall, sitting there,
with exquisitely dropping grace, under the lamp&ndash;&ndash;in the
shower of soft, yellow light: by which her tawny hair
was set aglow, and the shadows, lying below her great,
blue eyes, were deepened, in sympathy with her appealing
grief. Came, then, this Dannie Callaway, in his
London clothes, arrived direct per S.S. <i>Cathian</i>: came
this enamoured young fellow, with his educated stare,
his legs (good and bad) long-trousered for the first time
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
in his life, his fingers sparkling, his neck collared and
his wrists unimpeachably cuffed, his chest &#8220;used&#8221; in
such a way as never, God knows! had it swelled before.
&#8217;Twas with no desire to indulge his uncle that he had
managed these adornments. Indeed not! &#8217;Twas a
wish, growing within his heart, to compass a winning
and distinguished appearance in the presence of the
maid he loved.</p>
<p>By this magnificence the maid was abashed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; says I, as I swaggered past the steerage.</p>
<p>There was no response.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is you happy, child,&#8221; says I, catching the trick of
the thing from my uncle, &#8220;along o&#8217; ol&#8217; Nick Top an&#8217; me
an&#8217; John Cather?&#8221;</p>
<p>My tutor laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh, Judy?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>The maid&#8217;s glance was fallen in embarrassment upon
her plate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dannie,&#8221; says my uncle, severely, &#8220;ye better get
under way with your feedin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>The which, being at once hungry and obedient, I
did: but presently, looking up, caught the poor maid
unself-conscious. She no longer grieved&ndash;&ndash;no longer
sat sad and listless in her place. She was peering
greedily into the cabin, as my uncle was wont to do,
her slim, white neck something stretched and twisted
(it seemed) to round a spreading cluster of buttercups.
&#8217;Twas a moving thing to observe. &#8217;Twas not a shocking
thing; &#8217;twas a thing melting to the heart&ndash;&ndash;&#8217;twas a
thing, befalling with a maid, at once to provide a lad
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
with chivalrous opportunity. The eyes were the great,
blue eyes of Judith&ndash;&ndash;grave, wide eyes, which, beneficently
touching a lad, won reverent devotion, flushed
the heart with zeal for righteousness. They were
Judith&#8217;s eyes, the same, as ever, in infinite depth of
shadow, like the round sky at night, the same in light,
like the stars that shine therein, the same in black-lashed
mystery, like the firmament God made with His
own hand. But still &#8217;twas with a most marvellously
gluttonous glance that she eyed the roast of fresh meat
on the table before me. &#8217;Twas no matter to <i>me</i>, to be
sure! for a lad&#8217;s love is not so easily alienated: &#8217;tis an
actual thing&ndash;&ndash;not depending upon a neurotic idealization:
therefore not to be disillusioned by these natural
appearances.</p>
<p>&#8220;Judy,&#8221; says I, most genially, &#8220;is you ever tasted
roast veal?&#8221;</p>
<p>She was much abashed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is you never,&#8221; I repeated, &#8220;tasted roast veal?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; she whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;<i>Sir</i>!&#8217;&#8221; cries I, astounded. &#8220;&#8216;Sir!&#8217;&#8221; I gasped.
&#8220;Maid,&#8221; says I, now in wrathful amazement forgetting
her afflicted state, &#8220;is you lost your senses?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;N-n-no, sir,&#8221; she stammered.</p>
<p>&#8220;For shame!&#8221; I scolded. &#8220;T&#8217; call me so!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Daniel,&#8221; my uncle interjected, &#8220;volume II., page
24. &#8216;<i>A distinguished politeness o&#8217; manners.</i>&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>By this my tutor was vastly amused, and delightedly
watched us, his twinkling glance leaping from face to
face.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not have it, Judy!&#8221; I warned her. &#8220;You&#8217;ll vex
me sore an you does it again.&#8221;</p>
<p>The maid would not look up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Volume II., page 25,&#8221; my uncle chided. &#8220;Underlined
by Sir Harry. &#8216;<i>An&#8217; this address an&#8217; manner should
be exceedin&#8217;ly respeckful.</i>&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Judy!&#8221; I implored.</p>
<p>She ignored me.</p>
<p>&#8220;An you calls me that again, maid,&#8221; I threatened, in
a rage, &#8220;you&#8217;ll be sorry for it. I&#8217;ll&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Holy Scripture!&#8221; roared my uncle, reaching for his
staff. &#8220;&#8216;<i>Spare the rod and spoil the child.</i>&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>I was not to be stopped by this. &#8217;Twas an occasion
too promising in disaster. She had sirred me like a
house-maid. Sir? &#8217;Twas past believing. That Judith
should be so overcome by fine feathers and a roosterly
strut! &#8217;Twas shocking to discover the effect of my
uncle&#8217;s teaching. It seemed to me that the maid must
at once be dissuaded from this attitude of inferiority
or my solid hope would change into a dream. Inferiority?
She must have no such fancy! Fixed within
her mind &#8217;twould inevitably involve us in some catastrophe
of feeling. The torrent of my wrath and supplication
went tumbling on: there was no staying it.
My uncle&#8217;s hand fell short of his staff; he sat stiff and
agape with astonished admiration: perceiving which,
my tutor laughed until my hot words were fair extinguished
in the noise he made. By this my uncle
was set laughing: whence the infection spread
to me. And then Judith peeped at me through the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
cluster of buttercups with the ghost of a roguish
twinkle.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll call you Dannie,&#8221; says she, slyly&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;t&#8217; save you
the lickin&#8217;!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Daniel,&#8221; cries my uncle, delighted, &#8220;one slug-shot.
Box with the star t&#8217; the box with the cross. Judy,&#8221; says
he, &#8220;move aft alongside o&#8217; that there roast veal!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas the beginning and end of this seeming difference
of station....</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>John Cather took us in hand to profit us. &#8217;Twas in
the learning he had&ndash;&ndash;&#8217;twas in every genteel accomplishment
he had himself mastered in the wise world he came
from&ndash;&ndash;that we were instructed. I would have Judy for
school-fellow: nor would I be denied&ndash;&ndash;not I! &#8217;Twas
the plan I made when first I knew John Cather&#8217;s business
in our house: else, thinks I, &#8217;twould be a mean,
poor match we should make of it in the end. I would
have her: and there, says I, with a toss and a stamp, to
my uncle&#8217;s delight, was an end of it! It came about in
this way that we three spent the days together in agreeable
employment: three young, unknowing souls&ndash;&ndash;two
lads and a maid. In civil weather, &#8217;twas in the sunlight
and breeze of the hills, &#8217;twas in shady hollows,
&#8217;twas on the warm, dry rocks, which the breakers could
not reach, &#8217;twas on the brink of the cliff, that Cather
taught us, leaving off to play, by my uncle&#8217;s command,
when we were tired of study; and when the wind blew
with rain, or fog got the world all a-drip, or the task was
incongruous with sunshine and fresh air (like multiplication),
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
&#8217;twas within doors that the lesson proceeded&ndash;&ndash;in
my library, which my uncle had luxuriously outfitted
for me, when still I was an infant, against this very
time.</p>
<p>&#8220;John Cather,&#8221; says I, one day, &#8220;you&#8217;ve a wonderful
tongue in your head.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas on the cliff of Tom Tulk&#8217;s Head. We had
climbed the last slope hand in hand, with Judith between,
and were now stretched out on the brink, resting
in the cool blue wind from the sea.</p>
<p>&#8220;A nimble tongue, Dannie,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;I&#8217;ll admit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A wonderful tongue!&#8221; I repeated. &#8220;John Cather,&#8221;
I exclaimed, in envious admiration, &#8220;you&#8217;ve managed
t&#8217; tell Judy in ten thousand ways that she&#8217;s pretty.&#8221;</p>
<p>Judith blushed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wisht,&#8221; says I, &#8220;that <i>I</i> was so clever as that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know still another way,&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay; an&#8217; a hundred more!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Another,&#8221; said he, softly, turning to Judith, who
would not look at him. &#8220;Shall I tell you, Judith?&#8221;</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;No?&#8221; said he. &#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>The answer was in a whisper&ndash;&ndash;given while the maid&#8217;s
hot face was still turned away. &#8220;I&#8217;m not wantin&#8217; you
to,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do, maid!&#8221; I besought her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not wantin&#8217; him to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis your eyes, I&#8217;ll be bound!&#8221; said I. &#8220;&#8217;Twill be
so clever that you&#8217;ll be glad to hear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m not <i>wantin&#8217;</i> him to,&#8221; she persisted.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span></div>
<p>My tutor smiled indulgently&ndash;&ndash;but with a pitiful little
trace of hurt remaining. &#8217;Twas as though he must
suffer the rebuff with no offended question. In the
maid &#8217;twas surely a wilful and bewildering thing to
deny him. I could not make it out: but wished, in
the breeze and sunlight of that day, that the wound
had not been dealt. &#8217;Twas an unkind thing in Judith,
thinks I; &#8217;twas a thing most cruel&ndash;&ndash;thus to coquette
with the friendship of John Cather.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Judy,&#8221; I pleaded, &#8220;leave un have his way!&#8221;</p>
<p>She picked at the moss.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will ye not, maid?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid!&#8221; she whispered in my ear.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; you&#8217;d stop for that!&#8221; I chided, not knowing
what she meant: as how should a lad?</p>
<p>It seemed she would.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis an unkind thing,&#8221; says I, &#8220;t&#8217; treat John Cather
so. He&#8217;ve been good,&#8221; says I, &#8220;t&#8217; <i>you</i>, Judy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dannie!&#8221; she wailed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t, Dannie!&#8221; Cather entreated.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d have ye listen, Judy,&#8221; said I, in earnest, kind
reproach, &#8220;t&#8217; what John Cather says. I&#8217;d have ye heed
his words. I&#8217;d have ye care for him.&#8221; Being then a
lad, unsophisticated in the wayward, mercilessly selfish
passion of love, ignorant of the unmitigated savagery of
the thing, I said more than that, in my folly. &#8220;I&#8217;d have
ye love John Cather,&#8221; says I, &#8220;as ye love me.&#8221; &#8217;Tis a
curious thing to look back upon. That I should snarl
the threads of our destinies! &#8217;Tis an innocency hard
to credit. But yet John Cather and I had no sensitive
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
intuition to warn us. How should we&ndash;&ndash;being men?
&#8217;Twas for Judith to perceive the inevitable catastrophe;
&#8217;twas for the maid, not misled by reason, schooled by
feeling into the very perfection of wisdom, to control
and direct the smouldering passion of John Cather and
me in the way she would, according to the power God
gives, in infinite understanding of the hearts of men, to
a maid to wield. &#8220;I&#8217;d have ye love John Cather,&#8221; says
I, &#8220;as ye love me.&#8221; It may be that a lad loves his
friend more than any other. &#8220;I&#8217;d have ye t&#8217; know,
Judy,&#8221; says I, gently, &#8220;that John Cather&#8217;s my friend.
I&#8217;d have ye t&#8217; know&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dannie,&#8221; Cather interrupted, putting an affectionate
hand on my shoulder, &#8220;you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re
saying.&#8221;</p>
<p>Judith turned.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do, John Cather,&#8221; says I. &#8220;I knows full well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Judith&#8217;s eyes, grown all at once wide and grave,
looked with wonder into mine. I was made uneasy&ndash;&ndash;and
cocked my head, in bewilderment and alarm.
&#8217;Twas a glance that searched me deep. What was this?
And why the warning? There was more than warning.
&#8217;Twas pain I found in Judith&#8217;s great, blue eyes. What
had grieved her? &#8217;Twas reproach, too&ndash;&ndash;and a flash of
doubt. I could not read the riddle of it. Indeed, my
heart began to beat in sheer fright, for the reproach and
doubt vanished, even as I stared, and I confronted a
sparkling anger. But presently, as often happened
with that maid, tears flushed her eyes, and the long-lashed
lids fell, like a curtain, upon her grief:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
whereupon she turned away, troubled, to peer at the sea,
breaking far below, and would not look at me again.
We watched her, John Cather and I, for an anxious
space, while she sat brooding disconsolate at the edge
of the cliff, a sweep of cloudless sky beyond. The slender,
sweetly childish figure&ndash;&ndash;with the tawny hair, I recall,
all aglow with sunlight&ndash;&ndash;filled the little world of
our thought and vision. There was a patch of moss
and rock, the green and gray of our land&ndash;&ndash;there was
Judith&ndash;&ndash;there was an infinitude of blue space. John
Cather&#8217;s glance was frankly warm; &#8217;twas a glance proceeding
from clear, brave, guileless eyes&ndash;&ndash;springing from
a limpid soul within. It caressed the maid, in a fashion,
thinks I, most brotherly. My heart warmed to the man;
and I wondered that Judith should be unkind to him
who was our friend.</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas a mystery.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will not listen, Judith?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;&#8217;Tis a
very pretty thing I want to say.&#8221;</p>
<p>Judith shook her head.</p>
<p>A flash of amusement crossed his face. &#8220;Please do!&#8221;
he coaxed.</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m quite proud of it,&#8221; says he, with a laugh in his
fine eyes. He leaned forward a little, and made as if
to touch her, but withdrew his hand. &#8220;I did not know,&#8221;
says he, &#8220;that I was so clever. I have it all ready. I
have every word in place. I&#8217;d like to say it&ndash;&ndash;for my own
pleasure, if not for yours. I think it would be a pity to
let the pretty words waste themselves unsaid. I&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;hope
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
you&#8217;ll listen. I&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;really hope you will. And
you will not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; she cried, sharply. &#8220;No, no!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; she repeated; and she slipped her hand into
mine, and hid them both snugly in the folds of her
gown, where John Cather could not see. &#8220;God wouldn&#8217;t
like it, John Cather,&#8221; says she, her little teeth all bare,
her eyes aflash with indignation, her long fingers so
closely entwined with mine that I wondered. &#8220;He
wouldn&#8217;t <i>&#8217;low</i> it,&#8221; says she, &#8220;an He knowed.&#8221;</p>
<p>I looked at John Cather in vague alarm.</p>
<div class='footnote'><a name='Footnote_0005' id='Footnote_0005'></a><a href='#FNanchor_0005'><span class='label'>[5]</span></a>
<p>This Sir Harry Airworthy, K.C.M.G., I must forthwith
explain, was that distinguished colonial statesman whose
retirement to the quiet and bizarre enjoyments of life was
so sincerely deplored at the time. His taste for the picturesque
characters of our coast was discriminating and insatiable.
&#8217;Twas no wonder, then, that he delighted in my uncle,
whose familiar companion he was in St. John&#8217;s. I never
knew him, never clapped eyes on him, that I recall; he died
abroad before I was grown presentable. &#8217;Twas kind in him,
I have always thought, to help my uncle in his task of transforming
me, for &#8217;twas done with no personal responsibility
whatsoever in the matter, but solely of good feeling. I
owed him but one grudge, and that a short-lived one, going
back to the year when I was seven: &#8217;twas by advice o&#8217; Sir
Harry that I was made to tub myself, every morning, in
the water of the season, be it crusted with ice or not, with
my uncle listening at the door to hear the splash and gasp.</p>

<h2>XVII</h2>
<h3>RUM AND RUIN</h3>
</div>
<p>In these days at Twist Tickle, his perturbation
passed, my uncle was most blithe: for the <i>Shining
Light</i> was made all ready for sea, with but an
anchor to slip, sails to raise, for flight from an army
of St. John&#8217;s constables; and we were a pleasant
company, well fallen in together, in a world of fall
weather. And, says he, if the conduct of a damned
little Chesterfieldian young gentleman was a labor
t&#8217; manage, actin&#8217; accordin&#8217; t&#8217; that there fashionable
ol&#8217; lord of the realm, by advice o&#8217; Sir Harry, whatever
the lad in the case, whether good or bad, why,
then, a maid o&#8217; the place, ecod! was but a pastime t&#8217;
rear, an&#8217; there, says he, you had it! &#8217;Twas at night,
when he was come in from the sea, and the catch was
split, and we sat with him over his rum, that he beamed
most widely. He would come cheerily stumping from
his mean quarters above, clad in the best of his water-side
slops, all ironed and brushed, his great face glossy
from soap and water, his hair dripping; and he would
fall into the arms of his great-chair by the fire with a
genial grunt of satisfaction, turning presently to regard
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
us, John Cather and Judy and me, with a grin so wide
and sparkling and benevolently indulgent and affectionate&ndash;&ndash;with
an aspect so patriarchal&ndash;&ndash;that our hearts
would glow and our faces responsively shine.</p>
<p>&#8220;Up with un, Dannie!&#8221; says he.</p>
<p>I would lift the ailing bit of timber to the stool with
gingerly caution.</p>
<p>&#8220;Easy, lad!&#8221; groans he. &#8220;Ouch! All ship-shape,&#8221;
says he. &#8220;Is you got the little brown jug o&#8217; water?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twould surely be there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Green pastures!&#8221; says he, so radiantly red, from his
bristling gray stubble of hair to the folds of his chin,
that I was reminded of a glowing coal. &#8220;There you
haves it, Dannie!&#8221; cries he. &#8220;I knowed they was some
truth in that there psa&#8217;m. Green pastures! &#8216;<i>He
maketh me t&#8217; lie down in green pastures.</i>&#8217; Them ol&#8217;
bullies was wise as owls.... Pass the bottle, Judy.
Thank &#8217;e, maid. Ye&#8217;re a wonderful maid t&#8217; blush,
thank God! for they&#8217;s nothin&#8217; so pretty as that. I&#8217;m
a old, old man, Judy; but t&#8217; this day, maid, &#8217;tis fair
painful t&#8217; keep from kissin&#8217; red cheeks, whenever I
sees un. Judy,&#8221; says he, with a wag, his hand on the
bottle, &#8220;I&#8217;d rather be tempted by mermaids or angels&ndash;&ndash;I
cares not which&ndash;&ndash;than by a mortal maid&#8217;s red
cheeks! &#8217;Twould be wonderful easy,&#8221; says he, &#8220;t&#8217; resist
a angel.... Green pastures! Eh, Dannie, b&#8217;y?
Times is changed, isn&#8217;t they? Not like it used t&#8217; be,
when you an&#8217; me sot here alone t&#8217; drink, an&#8217; you was
on&#8217;y a wee little lad. I wisht ye was a wee little lad
again, Dannie; but Lord love us!&#8221; cries he, indignant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
with the paradox, &#8220;when ye <i>was</i> a wee little lad I wisht
ye was growed. An&#8217; there you haves it!&#8221; says he, dolefully.
&#8220;There you haves it!... I &#8217;low, Dannie,&#8221; says
he, anxiously, his bottle halted in mid-air, &#8220;that <i>you&#8217;d</i>
best pour it out. I&#8217;m a sight too happy, the night,&#8221;
says he, &#8220;t&#8217; be trusted with a bottle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Tis like he would have gone sober to bed had I not
been there to measure his allowance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye&#8217;re not so wonderful free with the liquor,&#8221; he
pouted, &#8220;as ye used t&#8217; be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas Judy who had put me up to it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye might be a <i>drop</i> more free!&#8221; my uncle accused.</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas reproachful&ndash;&ndash;and hurt me sore. That I should
deny my uncle who had never denied me! I blamed
the woman. &#8217;Tis marvellous how this frailty persists.
That Judith, Twist Tickle born, should deliberately
introduce the antagonism&ndash;&ndash;should cause my uncle to
suffer, me to regret! &#8217;Twas hard to forgive the maid
her indiscretion. I was hurt: for, being a lad, not a
maid of subtle perceptions, I would not have my uncle
go lacking that which comforted his distress and melancholy.
Faith! but I had myself been looking forward
with a thirsty gullet to the day&ndash;&ndash;drawn near, as I
thought&ndash;&ndash;when I should like a man drink hard liquor
with him in the glow of our fire: as, indeed, had he, by
frank confession, indiscreetly made when he was grown
horrified or wroth with my intemperance with ginger-ale.</p>
<p>&#8220;God save ye, Dannie!&#8221; he would expostulate, most
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
heartily, most piously; &#8220;but I <i>wisht</i> ye&#8217;d overcome the
bilge-water habit.&#8221;</p>
<p>I would ignore him.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis on&#8217;y a matter o&#8217; <i>will</i>,&#8221; says he. &#8220;&#8217;Tis nothin&#8217;
more than that. An&#8217; I&#8217;m fair ashamed,&#8221; he groaned,
in sincere emotion, &#8220;to think ye&#8217;re shackled, hand an&#8217;
foot, to a bottle o&#8217; ginger-ale. For shame, lad&ndash;&ndash;t&#8217; come
t&#8217; such a pass.&#8221; He was honest in his expostulation;
&#8217;twas no laughing matter&ndash;&ndash;&#8217;twas an anxiously grave
concern for my welfare. He disapproved of the beverage&ndash;&ndash;having
never tasted it. &#8220;<i>You</i>,&#8221; cries he, with a
pout and puff of scorn, &#8220;an&#8217; your bilge-water! In irons
with a bottle o&#8217; ginger-ale! Could ye but see yourself,
Dannie, ye&#8217;d quit quick enough. &#8217;Tis a ridiculous picture
ye make&ndash;&ndash;you an&#8217; your bottle. &#8217;Twould not be hard
t&#8217; give it up, lad,&#8221; he would plead. &#8220;Ye&#8217;ll manage it,
Dannie, an ye&#8217;d but put your mind to it. Ye&#8217;d be
nervous, I&#8217;ve no doubt, for a spell. But what&#8217;s that?
Eh, what&#8217;s that&ndash;&ndash;ag&#8217;in your health?&#8221;</p>
<p>I would sip my ginger-ale unheeding.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; what about Chesterfield?&#8221; says he.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have another bottle, sir,&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord love us!&#8221; he would complain, in such distress
that I wish I had not troubled him with this passion.
&#8220;Ye&#8217;re fair bound t&#8217; ruin your constitution with
drink.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pop went the cork.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; here&#8217;s <i>me</i>&#8221; says he, in disgusted chagrin,
&#8220;tryin&#8217; t&#8217; make a gentleman out o&#8217; ye!&#8221;</p>
<p>Ah, well! &#8217;twas now a mean, poor lookout for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
cosey conviviality I had all my life promised myself with
my uncle. Since the years when late o&#8217; nights I occupied
the arms and broad knee of Cap&#8217;n Jack Large at
the Anchor and Chain&ndash;&ndash;with a steaming comfort within
and a rainy wind blowing outside&ndash;&ndash;my uncle and I had
dwelt upon the time when I might drink hard liquor
with him like a man. &#8217;Twould be grand, says my
uncle, to sit o&#8217; cold nights, when I was got big, with a
bottle o&#8217; Long Tom between. A man grown&ndash;&ndash;a man
grown able for his bottle! For him, I fancy, &#8217;twas a
vision of successful achievement and the reward of it.
Lord love us! says he, but the talk o&#8217; them times would
be lovely. The very thought of it, says he&ndash;&ndash;the thought
o&#8217; Dannie Callaway grown big and manly and helpfully
companionable&ndash;&ndash;fair warmed him with delight. But
now, at Twist Tickle, with the strong, sly hands of
Judith upon our ways, with her grave eyes watching,
now commending, now reproaching, &#8217;twas a new future
that confronted us. Ay, but that maid, dwelling responsibly
with us men, touched us closely with control!
&#8217;Twas a sharp eye here, a sly eye there, a word, a twitch
of her red lips, a lift of the brow and dark lashes&ndash;&ndash;and
a new ordering of our lives. &#8217;Tis marvellous how she
did it: but that she managed us into better habits, by
the magic mysteriously natural to a maid, I have neither
the wish nor the will to gainsay. I grieved that she
should deprive my uncle of his comfort; but being a
lad, devoted, I would not add one drop to my uncle&#8217;s
glass, while Judith sat under the lamp, red-cheeked in
the heat of the fire, her great eyes wishful to approve,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
her mind most captivatingly engaged, as I knew, with
the will of God, which was her own, dear heart! though
she did not know it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dannie,&#8221; says she, in private, &#8220;God wouldn&#8217;t &#8217;low
un more&#8217;n a quarter of a inch at a time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twas in the pantry while I got the bottle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; how,&#8221; quoth I, &#8220;is you knowin&#8217; that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, child,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;God tol&#8217; me so.&#8221;</p>
<p>I writhed. &#8217;Twas a fancy so strange the maid had:
but was yet so true and reverent and usefully efficient&ndash;&ndash;so
high in leading to her who led us with her into pure
paths&ndash;&ndash;that I must smile and adore her for it. &#8217;Twas
to no purpose, as I knew, to thresh over the improbability
of the communication: Judith&#8217;s eyes were round
and clear and unwavering&ndash;&ndash;full of most exalted truth,
concern, and confidence. There was no pretence anywhere
to be descried in their depths: nor evil nor subterfuge
of any sort. And it seems to me, now, grown as I
am to sager years, that had the Guide whose hand she
held upon the rough road of her life communed with
His sweet companion, &#8217;twould have been no word of
reproach or direction he would whisper for her, who
needed none, possessing all the wisdom of virtue, dear
heart! but a warning in my uncle&#8217;s behalf, as she would
have it, against the bottle he served. The maid&#8217;s whimsical
fancy is not incomprehensible to me, neither tainted
with irreverence nor untruth: &#8217;twas a thing flowering
in the eyrie garden of her days at Whisper Cove&ndash;&ndash;a
thing, as I cannot doubt, of highest inspiration.</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; I protested, glibly, looking away, most wishful,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
indeed, to save my uncle pain, &#8220;I isn&#8217;t able t&#8217;
measure a quarter of a inch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>I</i> could,&#8221; says she.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not with the naked eye, maid!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; says she, &#8220;you might try, jus&#8217; t&#8217; please God.&#8221;</p>
<p>To be sure I might: I might pour at a guess. But,
unhappily (and it may be that there is some philosophy
in this for a self-indulgent world), I was not in awe of
Judith&#8217;s fantastic conception of divinity, whatever I
thought of my own, by whom, however, I was not conjured.
Moreover, I loved my uncle, who had continued
to make me happy all my life, and would venture far
in the service of his comfort. The twinkling, benevolent
aspect of the maid&#8217;s Deity could not compel a lad
to righteousness: I could with perfect complacency
conduct myself perversely before it. And must we
then, lads and men, worship a God of wrath, quick to
punish, niggardly in fatherly forgiveness, lest we stray
into evil ways? I do not know. &#8217;Tis beyond me to
guess the change to be worked in the world by a new
conception of the eternal attributes.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; will you not?&#8221; says she.</p>
<p>It chanced, now, that she held the lamp near her
face, so that her beauty was illumined and transfigured.
&#8217;Twas a beauty most tender&ndash;&ndash;most pure and elfin and
religious. &#8217;Tis a mean, poor justification, I know, to
say that I was in some mysterious way&ndash;&ndash;by the magic
resident in the beauty of a maid, and virulently, wickedly
active within its sphere, which is the space the
vision of a lad may carry&ndash;&ndash;that I was by this magic incapacitated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
and overcome. &#8217;Tis an excuse made by
fallen lads since treason was writ of; &#8217;tis a mere excuse,
ennobling no traitorious act: since love, to be sure, has
no precedence of loyalty in hearts of truth and manful
aspiration. Love? surely it walks with glorious modesty
in the train of honor&ndash;&ndash;or is a brazen baggage. But,
as it unhappily chanced, whatever the academic conception,
the maid held the lamp too close for my salvation:
so close that her blue, shadowy eyes bewildered me, and
her lips, red and moist, with a gleam of white teeth
between, I recall, tempted me quite beyond the endurance
of self-respect. I slipped, indeed, most sadly in
the path, and came a shamefaced, ridiculous cropper.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; will you not,&#8221; says she, &#8220;pour but a quarter
of a inch t&#8217; the glass?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; I swore, &#8220;for a kiss!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas an outrageous betrayal of my uncle.</p>
<p>&#8220;For shame!&#8221; cries she.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will for a kiss,&#8221; I repeated, my soul offered on a
platter to the devil, &#8220;regardless o&#8217; the consequences.&#8221;</p>
<p>She matched my long words with a great one caught
from my tutor. &#8220;God isn&#8217;t inclined,&#8221; says she, with a
toss, &#8220;in favor o&#8217; kisses.&#8221;</p>
<p>And there you had it!</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>When we sat late, our maid-servant would indignantly
whisk Judith off to bed&ndash;&ndash;crying out upon us for our
wickedness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cather,&#8221; my uncle would drawl, Judith being gone,
&#8220;ye&#8217;re all wore out along o&#8217; too much study.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Not at all, Skipper Nicholas!&#8221; cries my tutor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Study,&#8221; says my uncle, in solemn commiseration,
&#8220;is a bitter thing t&#8217; be cotched by. Ye&#8217;re all wore out,
parson, along o&#8217; the day&#8217;s work.&#8221;</p>
<p>My tutor laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Too much study for the brain,&#8221; says my uncle,
sympathetically, his eye on the bottle. &#8220;I &#8217;low, parson,
if I was you I&#8217;d turn in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cather was unfailingly obedient.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dannie,&#8221; says my uncle, with reviving interest,
&#8220;have he gone above?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He have,&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take a look,&#8221; he whispered, &#8220;t&#8217; see that Judy&#8217;s
stowed away beyond hearin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>I would step into the hall&ndash;&ndash;where was no nightgowned
figure listening on the stair&ndash;&ndash;to reassure him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dannie,&#8221; says he, wickedly gleeful, &#8220;how&#8217;s the
bottle?&#8221;</p>
<p>I would hold it up to the lamp and rattle its contents.
&#8220;&#8217;Tis still stout, sir,&#8221; says I. &#8220;&#8217;Tis a wonderful bottle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stout!&#8221; cries he, delighted. &#8220;Very good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Still stout,&#8221; says I; &#8220;an&#8217; the third night!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; says he, pushing his glass towards me, &#8220;I
&#8217;low they&#8217;s no real need o&#8217; puttin&#8217; me on short allowance.
Be liberal, Dannie, b&#8217;y&ndash;&ndash;be liberal when ye pours.&#8221;</p>
<p>I would be liberal.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis somehow sort o&#8217; comfortable, lad,&#8221; says he,
eying me with honest feeling, &#8220;t&#8217; be sittin&#8217; down here
with a ol&#8217; chum like you. &#8217;Tis very good, indeed.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was glad that he thought so.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span></div>
<p>And now I must tell that I loved Judith. &#8217;Tis
enough to say so&ndash;&ndash;to write the bare words down. I&#8217;m
not wanting to, to be sure: for it shames a man to
speak boldly of sacred things like this. It shames a
lad, it shames a maid, to expose the heart of either, save
sacredly to each other. &#8217;Tis all well enough, and most
delightful, when the path is moonlit and secluded, when
the warmth and thrill of a slender hand may be felt,
when the stars wink tender encouragement from the
depths of God&#8217;s own firmament, when all the world is
hushed to make the opportunity: &#8217;tis then all well
enough to speak of love. There is nothing, I know, to
compare in ecstasy with the whisper and sigh and clinging
touch of that time&ndash;&ndash;to compare with the awe and
mystery and solemnity of it. But &#8217;tis sacrilegious and
most desperately difficult and embarrassing, I find, at
this distant day, to write of it. I had thought much
upon love, at that wise age&ndash;&ndash;fifteen, it was, I fancy&ndash;&ndash;and
it seemed to me, I recall, a thing to cherish within
the heart of a man, to hide as a treasure, to dwell upon,
alone, in moments of purest exaltation. &#8217;Twas not a
thing to bandy about where punts lay tossing in the lap
of the sea; &#8217;twas not a thing to tell the green, secretive
old hills of Twin Islands; &#8217;twas not a thing to which the
doors of the workaday world might be opened, lest the
ribaldry to which it come offend and wound it: &#8217;twas a
thing to conceal, far and deep, from the common gaze
and comment, from the vulgar chances, the laugh and
cynical exhaustion and bleared wit of the life we live.
I loved Judith&ndash;&ndash;her eyes and tawny hair and slender
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
finger-tips, her whimsical way, her religious, loving soul.
I loved her; and I would not have you think &#8217;twas any
failure of adoration to pour my uncle an honest dram
of rum when she was stowed away in innocency of all
the evil under the moon. &#8217;Tis a thing that maids have
nothing to do with, thinks I; &#8217;tis a knowledge, indeed,
that would defile them....</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&#8220;Dannie,&#8221; says my uncle, once, when we were left
alone, &#8220;he&#8217;ve begun t&#8217; fall.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was mystified.</p>
<p>&#8220;The parson,&#8221; he explained, in a radiant whisper;
&#8220;he&#8217;ve begun t&#8217; yield.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;T&#8217; what?&#8221; I demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Temptation. He&#8217;ve a dark eye, lad, as I &#8217;lowed
long ago, an&#8217; he&#8217;ve begun t&#8217; give way t&#8217; argument.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;God&#8217;s sake, Uncle Nick!&#8221; I cried, &#8220;leave the poor
man be. He&#8217;ve done no harm.&#8221;</p>
<p>He scratched his stubble of hair, and contemplatively
traced a crimson scar with his forefinger. &#8220;No,&#8221; he
mused, his puckered, weathered brow in a doubtful
frown; &#8220;not so far. But,&#8221; he added, looking cheerily
up, &#8220;I&#8217;ve hopes that I&#8217;ll manage un yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Leave un alone,&#8221; I pleaded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; says he, with a hitch of his wooden leg; &#8220;but
I <i>needs</i> un.&#8221;</p>
<p>I protested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye don&#8217;t s&#8217;pose, Dannie,&#8221; he complained, in a
righteous flash, &#8220;that I&#8217;m able t&#8217; live forever, does
ye?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span></div>
<p>I did not, but heartily wished he might; and by this
sincere expression he was immediately mollified.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; says he, his left eyelid drooping in a knowing
way, his whole round person, from his topmost bristle
to his gouty wooden toe, braced to receive the shock of
my congratulation, &#8220;I&#8217;ve gone an&#8217; worked that there
black-an&#8217;-white young parson along! Sir Harry hisself,&#8221;
he declared, &#8220;couldn&#8217;t have done it no better. Nor ol&#8217;
Skipper Chesterfield, neither,&#8221; says he.</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas a pity.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he boasted, defiantly; &#8220;nor none o&#8217; them wise
ol&#8217; bullies of old!&#8221;</p>
<p>I sighed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dannie,&#8221; says he, with the air of imparting a grateful
secret, &#8220;I got that there black-an&#8217;-white young parson
corrupted. I got un,&#8221; he repeated, leaning forward,
his fantastic countenance alight with pride and satisfaction&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;I
got un corrupted! I&#8217;ve got un t&#8217; say,&#8221; says
he, &#8220;that &#8217;tis sometimes wise t&#8217; do evil that good may
come. An&#8217; when a young feller says that,&#8221; says he,
with a grave, grave nodding, so that his disfigurements
were all most curiously elongated, &#8220;he&#8217;ve sold his poor,
mean soul t&#8217; the devil.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wisht,&#8221; I complained, &#8220;that you&#8217;d leave the poor
man alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Dannie,&#8221; says my uncle, simply, &#8220;he&#8217;s paid
for!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Paid for!&#8221; cries I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, lad,&#8221; he chided; &#8220;t&#8217; be sure, that there young
black-an&#8217;-white parson is paid for.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span></div>
<p>I wondered how that might be.</p>
<p>&#8220;Paid for!&#8221; my uncle repeated, in a quivering, indrawn
breath, the man having fallen, all at once, into
gloom and terror. &#8220;&#8217;Tis all paid for!&#8221;</p>
<p>Here again was the disquieting puzzle of my childish
years: my uncle, having now leaned forward to come
close to me, was in a spasmodic way indicating the
bowels of the earth with a turned thumb. Down, down:
it seemed he pointed to infinite depths of space and woe.
Down, down&ndash;&ndash;continuing thus, with a slow, grevious
wagging of the great, gray head the sea had in the brutal
passion of some wild night maltreated. The familiar
things of the room, the simple, companionable furniture
of that known place, with the geometrically tempestuous
ocean framed beyond, were resolved into a background
of mysterious shadows as I stared; there was nothing
left within the circle of my vision but a scared gargoyle,
leaning into the red glow of the fire. My uncle&#8217;s round
little eyes protruded&ndash;&ndash;started from the bristles and
purpling scars and brown flesh of his broad face&ndash;&ndash;as
many a time before I had in sad bewilderment watched
them do. Paid for&ndash;&ndash;all the pride and comfort and
strange advantages of my life! All paid for in the
black heart of this mystery! And John Cather, too!
I wondered again, with an eye upon my uncle&#8217;s significantly
active thumb, having no courage to meet his
poignant glance, how that might be. According to my
catechism, severely taught in other years, I must ask no
questions, but must courteously await enlightenment at
my uncle&#8217;s pleasure; and &#8217;twas most marvellously
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
hard&ndash;&ndash;this night of all the nights&ndash;&ndash;to keep my soul unspotted
from the sin of inquisitiveness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Paid for,&#8221; my uncle repeated, hoarse with awe, &#8220;by
poor Tom Callaway!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas kind in my father, thinks I, to provide thus
bounteously for my welfare.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor Tom!&#8221; my uncle sighed, now recovering his
composure. &#8220;Poor, poor ol&#8217; Tom&ndash;&ndash;in the place he&#8217;s
to!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Still an&#8217; all, Uncle Nick,&#8221; I blundered, &#8220;I wisht
you&#8217;d leave my tutor be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye&#8217;re but a child!&#8221; he snapped. &#8220;Put the stopper
in the bottle. &#8217;Tis time you was in bed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas an unexpected rebuke. I was made angry
with him, for the only time in all my life; and to revenge
myself I held the bottle to the lamp, and deliberately
measured its contents, before his astonished eyes,
so that, though I left it with him, he could not drink
another drop without my knowing it; and I stoppered
the bottle, as tight as I was able, and left him to get his
wooden toe from the stool with the least agony he could
manage, and would not bank the fire or light his night-lamp.
I loved my tutor, and would not have him corrupted;
&#8217;twas a hateful thought to conceive that he
might come unwittingly to ruin at our hands. &#8217;Twas
a shame in my old uncle, thinks I, to fetch him to
despair. John Cather&#8217;s soul bargained for and bought!
&#8217;Twas indeed a shame to say it. There was no evil in
him when he came clear-eyed from the great world beyond
us; there should be no evil in him when he left us,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
whenever that might be, to renew the life he would not
tell us of. I looked my uncle in the eye in a way that
hurt and puzzled him. I wish I had not; but I did, as
I pounded the cork home, and boldly slipped the screw
into my pocket. He would go on short allowance, that
night, thinks I: for his nails, broken by toil, would never
pick the stopper out. And I prepared, in a rage, to fling
out of the room, when&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dannie!&#8221; he called.</p>
<p>I halted.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this?&#8221; says he, gently. &#8220;It never happened
afore, little shipmate, betwixt you an&#8217; me. What&#8217;s
this?&#8221; he begged. &#8220;I&#8217;m troubled.&#8221;</p>
<p>I pulled the cork of his bottle, and poured a dram,
most liberally, to delight his heart; and I must turn my
face away, somehow, to hide it from him, because of
shame for this mean doubt of him, ungenerous and ill-begotten.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m troubled,&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;What&#8217;s this, lad?&#8221;</p>
<p>I could not answer him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is I been unkind, Dannie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; I sobbed. &#8220;&#8217;Tis that I&#8217;ve been wicked t&#8217;
<i>you</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked at me with eyes grown very grave. &#8220;Ah!&#8221;
says he, presently, comprehending. &#8220;That&#8217;s good,&#8221;
says he, in his slow, gentle way. &#8220;That&#8217;s very good.
But ye&#8217;ll fret no more, will ye, Dannie? An&#8217; ye&#8217;ve
growed too old t&#8217; cry. Go t&#8217; bed, lad. Ye&#8217;re all wore
out. I&#8217;ll manage the lamp alone. God bless ye. Go
t&#8217; bed.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span></div>
<p>I waited.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good,&#8221; he repeated, in a muse, staring deep
into the red coals in the grate. &#8220;That&#8217;s very good.&#8221;</p>
<p>I ran away&ndash;&ndash;closed my door upon this wretched behavior,
but could not shut its ghastly sauciness and
treachery from the chambers of my memory. The
habit of faith and affection was strong: I was no longer
concerned for my friend John Cather, but was mightily
ashamed of this failure in duty to the grotesque old
hook-and-line man who had without reserve of sacrifice
or strength nourished me to the lusty years of that
night. As I lay in bed, I recall, downcast, self-accusing,
flushed with shame, I watched the low clouds scud
across the starlit sky, and I perceived, while the torn,
wind-harried masses rushed restlessly on below the
high, quiet firmament, that I had fallen far away from
the serenity my uncle would teach me to preserve in
every fortune.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not fail again!&#8221; thinks I. &#8220;Not I!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas an experience profitable or unprofitable, as you
shall presently judge.</p>

<h2>XVIII</h2>
<h3>A LEGACY OF LOVE</h3>
</div>
<p>Moses Shoos, I recall, carried the mail that winter.
&#8217;Twas a thankless task: a matter of thirty
miles to Jimmie Tick&#8217;s Cove and thirty back again.
Miles hard with peril and brutal effort&ndash;&ndash;a way of sleet
and slush, of toilsome paths, of a swirling mist of snow,
of stinging, perverse winds or frosty calm, of lowering
days and the haunted dark o&#8217; night&ndash;&ndash;to be accomplished,
once a week, afoot and alone, by way of barren and
wilderness and treacherous ice. &#8217;Twas a thankless task,
indeed; but &#8217;twas a task to which the fool of Twist
Tickle addressed himself with peculiar reverence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; says he, &#8220;always &#8217;lowed that a man ought
t&#8217; serve his Queen: an&#8217; mother knowed. &#8216;Moses,&#8217; says
she, afore she died, &#8216;a good man haves just <i>got</i> t&#8217; serve
the Queen: for an good men don&#8217;t,&#8217; says she, &#8216;the poor
Lady is bound t&#8217; come t&#8217; grief along o&#8217; rascals. Poor,
<i>poor</i> Lady!&#8217; says she. &#8216;She&#8217;ve a wonderful lot t&#8217; put
up with along o&#8217; stupid folk an&#8217; rascals. I&#8217;m not knowin&#8217;
how she bears it an&#8217; lives. &#8217;Tis a mean, poor dunderhead,
with heart an&#8217; brains in his gullet,&#8217; says she, &#8216;that
wouldn&#8217;t serve the Queen. God save the Queen!&#8217; says
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
mother. &#8216;What&#8217;s a man worth,&#8217; says she, &#8216;that on&#8217;y
serves hisself?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Not much, thinks I!</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; mother knowed,&#8221; says Moses, softly. &#8220;Ay,
Dannie,&#8221; he declared, with a proud little grin, &#8220;I bet
you <i>mother</i> knowed!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas this exalted ideal of public service, fashioned
in the wisdom of the simple by the amazing mother who
bore him, that led the fool, as by the hand, from a
wilderness of snow and night and bewildered visions,
wherein no aspiration of his own shaped itself, to the
warm hearth of Twist Tickle and the sleep of a child
by night.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Once I watched him stagger, white and bent with
weather and labor, from the ice of Ship&#8217;s Run, his bag
on his back, to the smoking roofs of Twist Tickle,
which winter had spread with a snowy blanket and tucked
in with anxious hands. &#8217;Twas a bitter day, cold,
windy, aswirl with the dust of snow, blinding as a mist.
I sat with Judith in the wide, deeply cushioned window-seat
of my lib&#8217;ry, as my uncle called the comfortable,
book-shelved room he had, by advice o&#8217; Sir Harry, provided
for my youth. John Cather was not about; and
I caressed, I recall, the long, slender fingers of her hand,
which unfailingly and without hesitation gave themselves
to my touch. She would never deny me that, this
maid; &#8217;twas only kisses she would hold me from. She
would snuggle close and warmly, when John Cather
was not about, but would call her God to witness that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
kisses were prohibited where happiness would continue.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis not <i>&#8217;lowed</i>, child,&#8221; says she.</p>
<p>Her cheek was so close, so round and soft and delicately
tinted, that I touched my lips to it, quite unable
to resist.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind <i>that</i>,&#8221; says she.</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas vastly encouraging.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twas so brotherly,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Judy,&#8221; I implored, &#8220;I&#8217;m in need of another o&#8217; that
same kind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;You&#8217;d never find the spot!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas with the maid, then, I sat in the window-seat
of my warm room, content with the finger-tips I might
touch and kiss as I would, lifted into a mood most holy
and aspiring by the weight of her small head upon my
shoulder, the bewildering light and mystery of her great,
blue eyes, the touch and sweet excitement of her tawny
hair, which brushed my cheek, as she well knew, this
perverse maid! John Cather was not about, and the
maid was yielding, as always in his absence; and I was
very happy. &#8217;Twas Moses we observed, all this time,
doggedly staggering, upon patriotic duty, from the white,
swirling weather of that unkind day, in the Queen&#8217;s
service, his bag on his back.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ve his mother t&#8217; guide un,&#8221; says she.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; his father?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis said that he was lost,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;in the
Year o&#8217; the Big Shore Catch; but I&#8217;m knowin&#8217; nothin&#8217;
about that.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span></div>
<p>I remembered the secret Elizabeth would impart to
my uncle Nicholas.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>My</i> father,&#8221; says Judith, in challenge, &#8220;was a very
good man.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was not disposed to deny it.</p>
<p>&#8220;A very good man,&#8221; she repeated, eying me sharply
for any sign of incredulity.</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas her fancy: I might indulge it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I &#8217;low, Dannie,&#8221; says she, &#8220;that he was a wonderful
handsome man, though I never seed un. God&#8217;s sake!&#8221;
cries she, defiantly, &#8220;he&#8217;d be hard t&#8217; beat for looks in
this here harbor.&#8221; She was positive; there was no uncertainty&ndash;&ndash;&#8217;twas
as though she had known him as
fathers are known. And &#8217;twas by no wish of mine,
now, that our hands came close together, that her eyes
were bent without reserve upon my own, that she snuggled
up to my great, boyish body: &#8217;twas wholly a wish
of the maid. &#8220;&#8217;Twas blue eyes he had,&#8221; says she, &#8220;an&#8217;
yellow hair an&#8217; big shoulders. He was a parson, Dannie,&#8221;
she proceeded. &#8220;I &#8217;low he must have been.
He&ndash;&ndash;he&ndash;&ndash;<i>was</i>!&#8221; she declared; &#8220;he was a great, big parson
with blue eyes.&#8221; I would not be a parson, thinks
I, whatever the maid might wish. &#8220;An&#8217; he &#8217;lowed,&#8221;
she continued, pursuing her wilful fancy, &#8220;that he&#8217;d
come back, some day, an&#8217; love my mother as she knowed
he could.&#8221; We watched Moses Shoos come across
the harbor ice and break open the door of the postmaster&#8217;s
cottage. &#8220;But he was wrecked an&#8217; drowned,&#8221;
says Judith, &#8220;an&#8217; &#8217;twas an end of my mother&#8217;s hope.
&#8217;Twas on&#8217;y that,&#8221; says she, &#8220;that she would tell Skipper
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
Nicholas on the night she died. &#8217;Twas just the wish
that he would bring me up, as he&#8217;ve fetched up you,
Dannie,&#8221; she added: &#8220;jus&#8217; that&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; the name o&#8217; my
father. I&#8217;m not sorry,&#8221; says she, with her head on my
shoulder, &#8220;that she never told the name.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth carried her secret into the greater mystery
to which she passed; &#8217;twas never known to us, nor to
any one....</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&#8220;Moses,&#8221; says I, in delight, when the news got
abroad, &#8220;I hears you got the contract for the mail?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I is,&#8221; says he.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; how in the name o&#8217; Heaven,&#8221; I demanded, &#8220;did
you manage so great a thing?&#8221;</p>
<p>There had been competition, I knew: there had been
consideration and consultation&ndash;&ndash;there had been the philosophy
of the aged concerning the carrying of mail in
past years, the saucy anarchy of the young with regard
to the gruelling service, the chatter of wishful women
upon the spending value of the return, the speculatively
saccharine brooding of children&ndash;&ndash;there had been much
sage prophecy and infinitely knowing advice&ndash;&ndash;there had
been misleading and secrecy and sly devising&ndash;&ndash;there
had been envy, bickering, disruption of friendship&ndash;&ndash;there
had been a lavish waste and disregard of character&ndash;&ndash;there
had been all this, as I knew, and more pitiable
still, in competition for the weekly four dollars of government
money. &#8217;Twas a most marvellous achievement,
thinks I, that the fool of Twist Tickle had from
this still weather of reason and tempest of feeling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
emerged with the laurel of wisdom (as my tutor said)
to crown him. &#8217;Twas fair hard to credit! I must know
the device&ndash;&ndash;the clever political trick&ndash;&ndash;by which the wags
and wiseacres of Twist Tickle had been discomfited.
&#8217;Twas with this hungry curiosity that I demanded of
the fool of Twist Tickle how he had managed so great
a thing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh, Moses,&#8221; says I; &#8220;how <i>was</i> it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dannie,&#8221; he gravely explained, &#8220;&#8217;tis very simple.
My bid,&#8221; says he, impressively, &#8220;was the lowest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; how much was that, Moses?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; he observed, &#8220;didn&#8217;t hold a wonderful lot
with half measures.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas no answer to my question.</p>
<p>&#8220;She always &#8217;lowed,&#8221; says he, with a mystifyingly
elaborate wave and accent, &#8220;that <i>doin&#8217;</i> was better than
<i>gettin&#8217;</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>I still must wait.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Moses,&#8217; says she,&#8221; he pursued, &#8220;&#8216;don&#8217;t you mind
the price o&#8217; fish; you <i>cotch</i> un. Fish,&#8217; says she, &#8216;is
fish; but prices goes up an&#8217; down, accordin&#8217; t&#8217; the folly
o&#8217; men. You <i>do</i>,&#8217; says she; &#8216;an&#8217; you leave what you
<i>gets</i> t&#8217; take care of itself.&#8217; An&#8217; I &#8217;low,&#8221; says Moses,
gently, a smile transfiguring his vacant face, &#8220;that
mother knowed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas all, it seemed to me, a defensive argument.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; mother &#8217;lowed, afore she died,&#8221; he added, looking
up to a gray sky, wherein a menace of snow
dwelt, &#8220;that a good man would save his Queen from
rascals.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; I complained; &#8220;but what was the bid that
won from Eli Flack?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The bid?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay; the bid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not expensive,&#8221; says he.</p>
<p>&#8220;But how much, Moses?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Dannie,&#8221; he answered, with a sigh and a rub
of his curly, yellow beard, &#8220;I &#8217;lowed mother wouldn&#8217;t
charge much for servin&#8217; the Queen: for,&#8221; says he, enlivened,
&#8220;&#8217;twould be too much like common labor t&#8217;
carry Her Majesty&#8217;s mail at a price. An&#8217; I bid,&#8221; he
added, eying me vaguely, &#8220;accordin&#8217; t&#8217; what I &#8217;lowed
mother would have me do in the Queen&#8217;s service.
<i>Fac&#8217; is, Dannie</i>,&#8221; says he, in a squall of confidence,
&#8220;<i>I &#8217;lowed I&#8217;d carry it free!</i>&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&#8217;Twas this contact with the world of Jimmie Tick&#8217;s
Cove that embarked the fool upon an adventurous
enterprise. When, in the spring of that year, the sea
being open, the <i>Quick as Wink</i> made our harbor, the
first of all the traders, Tumm, the clerk, was short-handed
for a cook, having lost young Billy Rudd overboard,
in a great sea, beating up in stress of weather
to the impoverished settlement at Diamond Run. &#8217;Twas
Moses, the choice of necessity, he shipped in the berth
of that merry, tow-headed lad of tender voice, whose
songs, poor boy! would never again be lifted, o&#8217; black
nights in harbor, in the forecastle of the <i>Quick as Wink</i>.
&#8220;Ay, Dannie,&#8221; says Moses, &#8220;you&#8217;d never think it, maybe,
but I&#8217;m shipped along o&#8217; Tumm for the French
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
shore an&#8217; the Labrador ports. I&#8217;ve heared tell a wonderful
lot about Mother Burke, but I&#8217;ve never seed the
ol&#8217; rock; an&#8217; I&#8217;ve heared tell a wonderful lot about
Coachman&#8217;s Cove an&#8217; Conch an&#8217; Lancy Loop an&#8217; the
harbors o&#8217; the straits shores, but I&#8217;ve never seed un
with my own eyes, an&#8217; I&#8217;m sort o&#8217; wantin&#8217; t&#8217; know how
they shapes up alongside o&#8217; Twist Tickle. I &#8217;low,&#8221;
says he, &#8220;you don&#8217;t find many harbors in the world like
Twist Tickle. Since I been travellin&#8217; t&#8217; Jimmie Tick&#8217;s
Cove with the mail,&#8221; he continued, with a stammer and
flush, like a man misled from an austere path by the
flesh-pots of earth, &#8220;I&#8217;ve cotched a sinful hankerin&#8217; t&#8217;
see the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>I wished he had not.</p>
<p>&#8220;But mother,&#8221; he added, quickly, in self-defence,
&#8220;always &#8217;lowed a man <i>ought</i> t&#8217; see the world. So,&#8221;
says he, &#8220;I&#8217;m shipped along o&#8217; Tumm, for better or for
worse, an&#8217; I&#8217;m bound down north in the <i>Quick as Wink</i>
with the spring supplies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas a far journey for that sensitive soul.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dannie,&#8221; he asked, in quick alarm, a fear so sudden
and unexpected that I was persuaded of the propriety
of my premonition, &#8220;what you thinkin&#8217; about? Eh,
Dannie?&#8221; he cried. &#8220;What you lookin&#8217; that way for?&#8221;</p>
<p>I would not tell him that I knew the skipper of the
<i>Quick as Wink</i>, whose butt the fool must be.</p>
<p>&#8220;You isn&#8217;t &#8217;lowin&#8217;,&#8221; Moses began, &#8220;that mother&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all, Moses!&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas instant and complete relief he got from this
denial. &#8220;We sails,&#8221; says he, with all a traveller&#8217;s importance,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
&#8220;at dawn o&#8217; to-morrow. I&#8217;ll be gone from
Twist Tickle by break o&#8217; day. I&#8217;ll be gone t&#8217; new
places&ndash;&ndash;t&#8217; harbors I&#8217;ve heared tell of but never seed
with my own eyes. I&#8217;m not quite knowin&#8217;,&#8221; says he,
doubtfully, &#8220;how I&#8217;ll get along with the cookin&#8217;. Mother
always &#8217;lowed,&#8221; he continued, with a greater measure of
hope, &#8220;that I was more&#8217;n fair on cookin&#8217; a cup o&#8217; tea.
&#8216;Moses,&#8217; says she, &#8216;you can brew a cup o&#8217; tea so well as
any fool I ever knowed.&#8217; But that was on&#8217;y mother,&#8221;
he added, in modest self-deprecation. &#8220;Jus&#8217; mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>I wished again that the fool had not fallen into the
mercilessly facetious company of Skipper Saucy Bill
North of the schooner <i>Quick as Wink</i>.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217;, Dannie,&#8221; says Moses, &#8220;I&#8217;m scared I&#8217;ll fail with
all but the tea.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas come near the evening of that mellow Sunday.
On the Whisper Cove road and the greening hills of
Twin Islands, where Moses and I had walked in simple
companionship, the birds had been mating and nesting
in the thick sunshine of the afternoon. Chirp and flutter
and shrill song! &#8217;Twas a time for the mating of
birds. The haste and noise and pomposity of this busy
love-making! The loud triumph and soft complaint of
it! All the world of spruce and alder and sunlit spaces
had been a-flutter. But the weather was now fallen
gloomy, the sky overcast, the wind blowing in from the
black, uneasy sea, where floes and gigantic bergs of ice
drifted, like frozen ghosts, cold and dead and aimlessly
driven; and the hopeful sunshine had left the hills, and
the piping and chirping were stilled, and I heard no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
more fluttering wings or tender love-songs. The fool
of Twist Tickle paused in the road to stare vacantly
northward. &#8217;Twas there dark with menacing clouds&ndash;&ndash;thick,
sombre clouds, tinged with a warning blue, rising
implacably above the roughening black of the sea. He
wondered, it may be, in his dull, weakling way, concerning
the coasts beyond the grave curtain, which he
must discover&ndash;&ndash;new coasts, dealing with us variously,
as we disclose them to our hearts. I watched him with
misgiving. To be sure, the skipper of the <i>Quick as
Wink</i> was an unkind man, cynical and quick to seek
selfish laughter, whatever the wound he dealt; but
Tumm, our friend and the genial friend of all the
world, thinks I, more hopefully, would not have the
poor fool wronged.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dannie,&#8221; says Moses, turning, &#8220;I&#8217;m scared my
cookin&#8217; won&#8217;t quite fit the stomachs o&#8217; the crew o&#8217; the
<i>Quick as Wink</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, Moses,&#8221; says I, to hearten him; &#8220;but never a
good man was that didn&#8217;t fear a new task.&#8221;</p>
<p>He eyed me doubtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217;,&#8221; I began, &#8220;your mother, Moses&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; he interrupted, &#8220;mother wasn&#8217;t quite t&#8217; be
trusted in all things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not trusted!&#8221; I cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll not misunderstand me, Dannie?&#8221; he besought
me, putting a hand on my shoulder. &#8220;You&#8217;ll
not misunderstand, will you? But mother wasn&#8217;t quite
t&#8217; be trusted,&#8221; says he, &#8220;when it come t&#8217; the discussion,&#8221;
says he, pausing to permit a proper appreciation of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
learned word, which he had appropriated from my
tutor&#8217;s vocabulary, &#8220;o&#8217; my accomplishments.&#8221;</p>
<p>It had never occurred before.</p>
<p>&#8220;For mother,&#8221; he explained, &#8220;was somehow wonderful
fond o&#8217; me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The church-bell called him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hear her voice, Dannie?&#8221; said he. &#8220;Hear her voice
in that there bell? &#8216;Come&ndash;&ndash;dear!&#8217; says she. &#8216;Come&ndash;&ndash;dear!
Come&ndash;&ndash;dear!&#8217; Hear it ring out? &#8216;Come&ndash;&ndash;dear!
Come&ndash;&ndash;dear! Come&ndash;&ndash;dear!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>I bade him God-speed with a heart that misgave me.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll answer,&#8221; said he, his face lifted to the sky, &#8220;to
that voice!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The clouds in the west broke, and through the rift a
shaft of sunlight shot, glad to be free, and touched our
world of sea and rock with loving finger-tips, but failed,
as I turned homeward, hearing no voice of my unknown
mother in the wandering call of the bell; and all the
world went gray and sullenly mute, as it had been....</p>

<h2>XIX</h2>
<h3>A WORD OF WARNING</h3>
</div>
<p>Presently my uncle and I made ready to set
out for St. John&#8217;s upon the sinister business which
twice a year engaged his evil talents at the wee waterside
place wherein he was the sauciest dog in the pack.
There was now no wandering upon the emotionless
old hills of Twin Islands to prepare him, no departure
from the fishing, no unseemly turning to
the bottle, to factitious rage; but he brooded more
despairingly in his chair by the window when the
flare of western glory left the world. At evening,
when he thought me gone upon my pleasure, I
watched him from the shadows of the hall, grave
with youth, wishing, all the while, that he might
greet the night with gratitude for the mercy of it; and
I listened to his muttering&ndash;&ndash;and I saw that he was
grown old and weak with age: unequal, it might be,
to the wickedness he would command in my service.
&#8220;<i>For behold the Lord will come with fire, and with his
chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury,
and his rebuke with the flames of fire.</i>&#8221; For me &#8217;twas
still sweet to watch the tender shadows creep upon the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
western fire, to see the great gray rocks dissolve, to hear
the sea&#8217;s melodious whispering; but to him the sea
spoke harshly and the night came with foreboding.
I wished that he would forsake the evil he followed
for my sake. I would be a club-footed, paddle-punt
fisherman, as the gray little man from St. John&#8217;s had
said, and be content with that fortune, could my uncle
but look into the eyes of night without misgiving.</p>
<p>But I must not tell him so....</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>We left John Cather behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Nick,&#8221; says I, &#8220;I &#8217;low we&#8217;d best have un
along.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; why?&#8221; cries he.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; says I, honestly puzzled.</p>
<p>He looked at me quizzically. &#8220;Is you sure?&#8221; he
asked. His eyes twinkled. &#8220;Is you sure you doesn&#8217;t
know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; I answered, frowning. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dannie,&#8221; says he, significantly, &#8220;&#8217;tisn&#8217;t time yet for
John Cather t&#8217; go t&#8217; St. John&#8217;s. You got t&#8217; take your
chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What chance?&#8221; I demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; says he.</p>
<p>I scowled.</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; says he, &#8220;an I was you I wouldn&#8217;t fear on no
account whatever. No,&#8221; he repeated, &#8220;<i>I</i> wouldn&#8217;t fear&ndash;&ndash;an
I was you.&#8221;</p>
<p>So John Cather was left with Judy and the watchful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
maid-servant who loved her, having no child of her own,
when my uncle and I fared out of the tickle upon the
outside boat. I was troubled in the dark and wash and
heave of that night, but could not for the life of me tell
why. John Cather had bade me good-bye with a heartening
laugh and clap on the shoulder. &#8217;Twas with
gratitude&ndash;&ndash;and sure persuasion of unworthiness&ndash;&ndash;that I
remembered his affection. And Judy had given me a
sisterly kiss of farewell which yet lingered upon my lips
so warmly that in my perplexity I was conscious of it
lying there and must like a thirsty man feel the place her
moist mouth had touched. &#8217;Twas grief, thinks I, because
of parting with my friend John Cather; and I
puzzled no longer, but devoted myself to the accomplishment
of manners, as I had been taught, and now attended
with interest, having grown old and wise. &#8217;Twas
rainy weather, windy, with the sea in an ugly pother off
the rocks of our hard coast. &#8217;Twas wet, blustering
weather, indeed, all the hapless time we were gone from
Twist Tickle: the tap-rooms of St. John&#8217;s, I recall, disagreeably
steamed and reeked. My uncle put me to
bed that night with a motherly injunction to recite the
twenty-third psalm for safety against the perils of the
sea and the machinations of wicked men, and to regard
the precepts of the noble Lord Chesterfield for guidance
in more difficult waters: the man being quite sober for
the first time in all my life upon these occasions of
departure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dannie, lad,&#8221; says he, &#8220;you cling t&#8217; that there little
anchor I&#8217;m give ye t&#8217; hold to.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span></div>
<p>I asked him mechanically what that was.</p>
<p>&#8220;The twenty-third psa&#8217;m,&#8221; says he.</p>
<p>To this I promised.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217;, Dannie,&#8221; says he, drawing the great bandanna
handkerchief from his trousers-pocket to blow his nose,
&#8220;don&#8217;t ye be gettin&#8217; lonely: for Dannie&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>I must sharply attend.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m for&#8217;ard,&#8221; he declared, &#8220;standin&#8217; by!&#8221;</p>
<p>He could not perceive, poor man! that I was no longer
to be dealt with as a child.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>There befell me in the city a singular encounter.
&#8217;Twas of a soggy, dismal day: there was a searching
wind abroad, I recall, to chill the marrow of impoverished
folk, a gray light upon all the slimy world, a dispiriting
fog flowing endlessly in scowling clouds over the
hills to thicken and eddy and drip upon the streets and
harbor. It being now at the crisis of my uncle&#8217;s intoxication,
I was come from my hotel alone, wandering
without aim, to speed the anxious hours. Abreast of
the familiar door of the Anchor and Chain, where long
ago I had gratefully drunk with Cap&#8217;n Jack Large, I
paused; and I wondered, as I stared at the worn brass
knob, now broken into beads of cold sweat with the
weather, whether or not I might venture some persuasion
upon my perverse uncle, but was all at once plucked
by the tail of my coat, and turned in a rage to resent
the impudence. &#8217;Twas but a scrawny, brass-buttoned
boy, however, with an errand for the lad with the
rings, as they called me. I followed, to be sure, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
was by this ill-nourished messenger led to the crossing
of King Street with Water, where my uncle was used
to tap-tapping the pavement. Thence in a moment we
ascended to a group of office-rooms, on the opposite
side of the street, wherein, having been ceremoniously
ushered, I found the gray stranger who had called me
a club-footed, ill-begotten young whelp, on that windy
night at Twist Tickle, and had with meaning complacency
threatened my uncle&#8217;s assassination.</p>
<p>I had not expected it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha!&#8221; snaps he. &#8220;Here you are, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>To my amazement.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know me?&#8221; he demanded.</p>
<p>I did not know his quality, which seemed, however,
by the state he dwelt in, by the deference he commanded
from the scrawny, brass-buttoned, ill-nourished, tragically
obsequious child who had fetched me, to be of
distinction.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down,&#8221; he bade me.</p>
<p>I would not.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well!&#8221; cries he. &#8220;You&#8217;ve manners as brief as
your memory.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas a vivid recollection that had shorn my manner
to the bare. My uncle had not been quick enough to
sweep the lamp from the table: I remembered this man.
&#8217;Twas he who had of that windy night most cruelly
damned me; &#8217;twas he who had struck my uncle.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve not forgot you, sir,&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>He was gray: he was indeed most incredibly gray&ndash;&ndash;gray
of hair and eye and brow and flesh, gray of mood
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
and outlook upon the world, forever dwelling, as it
seemed, in a gray fog of suspicion and irascibility. I
was gone over, from pate to shrinking club-foot, with
more intimate and intelligently curious observation than
ever a &#8217;longshore jack or coast-wise skipper had achieved
in the years when I wore rings. Never before had I suffered
a stare more keen and unabashed: &#8217;twas an assurance
stripped of insolence by some tragical need and
right. He sat beyond a broad, littered table, leaning
forward upon it, his back to the riley light, his drawn
face nestled within the lean, white hands of him; and
&#8217;twas now a brooding inspection I must bear&ndash;&ndash;an unself-conscious
thing, remote from my feeling, proceeding
from eyes as gray as winter through narrow slits that
rapidly snapped shut and flashed open in spasmodic
winking. He was a man of fashion, of authority, of
large affairs, it seemed&ndash;&ndash;a gentleman, according to my
uncle&#8217;s code and fashion-plates. But he was now by
my presence so wretchedly detached from the great
world he moved in that for a moment I was stirred to
pity him. What had this masterful little man, thinks
I, to fear from Dannie Callaway of Twist Tickle?</p>
<p>Enough, as it turned out; but &#8217;twas all an unhappy
mystery to me on that drear, clammy day.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, sir!&#8221; says I, in anger. &#8220;You&#8217;ve fetched me
here?&#8221;</p>
<p>He seemed not to hear.</p>
<p>&#8220;What you wantin&#8217; of me?&#8221; I brusquely asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; says he, sighing; &#8220;you are here, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;
He fingered the papers on his table in a way so desultory
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
and weak that once more I was moved to pity him.
Then, with blank eyes, and hopelessly hanging lip, a
lean finger still continuing to rustle the forgotten documents,
he looked out of the window, where &#8217;twas all
murky and dismal, harbor and rocky hill beyond obliterated
by the dispiriting fog. &#8220;I wish to warn you,&#8221;
he continued. &#8220;You think, perhaps,&#8221; he demanded,
looking sharply into my eyes, &#8220;that you are kin of mine?&#8221;</p>
<p>I had no such dreadful fear, and, being an unkind
lad, frankly told him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You dream,&#8221; he pursued, &#8220;that you were born to
some station?&#8221;</p>
<p>I would not have him know.</p>
<p>&#8220;Daniel,&#8221; says he, with a faint twinkle of amusement
and pity, &#8220;tell me of that wretched dream.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas a romantic hope that had lingered with me
despite my wish to have it begone: but I would not tell
this man. I had fancied, as what lad would not? but
with no actual longing, because of love for Judith, that
the ultimate revelation would lift me high in the world.
But now, in the presence of this gray personage, under
his twinkle and pitying grin, the fancy forever vanished
from me. &#8217;Twas comforting to know, at any rate, that
I might wed Judith without outrage. There would be
small difficulty, then, thinks I, in winning the maid;
and &#8217;twas most gratifying to know it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Daniel,&#8221; says he, in distress, &#8220;has that rascally Top
misled you to this ridiculously romantic conclusion?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; I answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are the son,&#8221; he declared, with thin-lipped deliberation,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
by which I was persuaded and sorely chagrined,
&#8220;of Tom Callaway, who was lost, with all hands
but the chiefest rascal it has been my lot to encounter,
in the wreck of the <i>Will-o&#8217;-the-Wisp</i>. Tom Callaway,
master: he was your father. Your mother,&#8221; he continued,
&#8220;was a St. John&#8217;s water-side maid&ndash;&ndash;a sweet and
lovely wife, who died when you were born. I was myself
not indifferent to her most pure and tender charms.
There is your pedigree,&#8221; says he, his voice fallen kind.
&#8220;No mystery, you see&ndash;&ndash;no romance. Tom Callaway,
master: he was your father. This man Top,&#8221; he
snapped, &#8220;this vulgar, drunken, villanous fellow, into
whose hands you have unhappily fallen and by whose
mad fancies you will inevitably be ruined, is the sole
survivor of the <i>Will-o&#8217;-the-Wisp</i>, with which your father
very properly went down. He is nothing to you&ndash;&ndash;nothing&ndash;&ndash;neither
kith nor kin! He is an intruder upon you:
he has no natural right to your affection; nor have you
a natural obligation to regard him. He has most
viciously corrupted you into the fantastic notion that
you are of gentle and fortunate birth. With what heart,
in God&#8217;s name!&#8221; the gray man cried, clapping his lean
hands in a passion, &#8220;he will face you when he must disclose
the truth, I cannot conceive. Mad! The man is
stark mad: for tell you he must, though he has in every
way since your childhood fostered within you a sense of
honor that will break in contempt upon him! Your
attitude, I warn you, will work wretchedness to you
both; you will accuse and flout him. Daniel,&#8221; the man
solemnly asked, &#8220;do you believe me?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span></div>
<p>I was glad to know that my mother had been both
sweet and lovely. &#8217;Twas a conception I had long cherished.
&#8217;Twas what Judith was&ndash;&ndash;both sweet and lovely.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will accuse him, I warn you!&#8221; he repeated.</p>
<p>Still gray weather, I observed through the grimy
panes: fog sweeping by with a northeast wind. For a
moment I watched the dripping passengers on the opposite
pavement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; says the gray stranger, with a harsh little
laugh, &#8220;God help Top when the tale is told!&#8221;</p>
<p>I should never, of course, treat my uncle with unkindness.</p>
<p>&#8220;My boy,&#8221; he most earnestly besought me, &#8220;will you
not heed me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll hear you, sir,&#8221; I answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Attend, then,&#8221; says he. &#8220;I have brought you here
to warn you, and my warning is but half spoken.
Frankly, in this I have no concern for your happiness,
with which I have nothing to do: I have been moved
to this ungrateful and most dangerous interview by a
purely selfish regard for my own career. Do you know
the word? A political career of some slight importance,&#8221;
he added, with a toss of the head, &#8220;which is now
menaced, at a most critical moment, by that merciless,
wicked old pirate whom you have shamelessly been
deceived into calling your uncle Nicholas. To be frank
with you, you are, and have been for several years, an
obstacle. My warning, however, as you will believe, is
advanced upon grounds advantageous to yourself. Put
the illusions of this designing old bay-noddie away from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
you,&#8221; says he, now accentuating his earnestness with a
lean, white forefinger. &#8220;Rid yourself of these rings and
unsuitable garments: they disgrace you. When the
means of their possession is disclosed to you&ndash;&ndash;when the
wretched crime of it is made known&ndash;&ndash;you will suffer
such humiliation as you did not dream a man could
feel. Put &#8217;em away. Put &#8217;em out of sight and mind.
Send that young man from London back to the business
he came from. A tutor! Your tutor! Tom Callaway&#8217;s
son with an English tutor! You are being made a
ghastly fool of; and I warn you that you will pay for
every moment of the illusion. Poor lad!&#8221; cries he, in
genuine distress. &#8220;Poor lad!&#8221;</p>
<p>It might be: I had long thought so.</p>
<p>&#8220;And as for this grand tour abroad,&#8221; he began, with
an insolently curling lip, &#8220;why, for God&#8217;s sake! don&#8217;t
be a&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir!&#8221; I interrupted, in a rage.</p>
<p>There had been talk of a trip abroad: it seemed I
was bound upon it, by advice of Sir Harry, to further my
education and to cure my foot of its twist.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; the gray personage laughed, &#8220;being what
you are, remembering what I have with candor and
exact honesty told you, if you can permit this old
pirate&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>I stopped him. I would have no more of it&ndash;&ndash;not I,
by Heaven!</p>
<p>&#8220;This extortionate old&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not hear it!&#8221; I roared.</p>
<p>&#8220;In this fine faith,&#8221; sneers he, &#8220;I find at least the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
gratifying prospect of being some day privileged to
observe Top broil as on a griddle in hell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas most obscure.</p>
<p>&#8220;I refer,&#8221; says he, &#8220;to the moment of grand climax
when this pirate tells you where your diamonds came
from. Your diamonds?&#8221; he flashed. &#8220;You may get
quit of your diamonds; but the fine gentleman this low
villain has fashioned of a fishing-skipper&#8217;s whelp will
all your days keep company at your elbow. And you
won&#8217;t love Top for this,&#8221; says he, with malevolent satisfaction;
&#8220;you won&#8217;t love Top!&#8221;</p>
<p>I walked to the window for relief from him. &#8217;Twas
all very well that he should discredit and damn my
uncle in this way; &#8217;twas all very well that he should
raise spectres of unhappiness before me: but there, on
the opposite pavement, abroad in the foggy wind,
jostled by ill-tempered passengers, was this self-same old
foster-father of mine, industriously tap-tapping the pavement
with his staff, as he had periodically done, whatever
the weather, since I could remember the years of
my life. I listened to the angry tapping, watched the
urchins and curious folk gather for the show; and I was
moved to regard the mystifying spectacle with an indulgent
grin. The gray stranger, however, at that instant
got ear of the patter of the staff and the clamor of
derision. He cried upon me sharply to stand from the
window; but I misliked this harsh manner of authority,
and would not budge: whereupon he sprang upon me,
caught me about the middle, and violently flung me back.
&#8217;Twas too late to avert the catastrophe: my uncle had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
observed me, and was even then bound across the street,
flying all sail, to the terrified confusion of the exalted
political personage whose career he menaced. &#8217;Twas a
pitiable spectacle of fright and helpless uncertainty the
man furnished, seeming at one moment bent on keeping
my uncle out, whom he feared to admit, at another to
wish him well in, whom he dared not exclude.</p>
<p>&#8220;The man&#8217;s stark mad!&#8221; he would repeat, in his panic
of gesture and pacing. &#8220;The man&#8217;s stark mad to risk
this!&#8221;</p>
<p>My uncle softly closed the door behind him. &#8220;Ah,
Dannie!&#8221; says he. &#8220;You here?&#8221; He was breathless,
and gone a ghastly color; there was that about his scars
and eyes, too, to make me wonder whether &#8217;twas rage or
fear had mastered him: I could not tell, but mightily
wished to determine, since it seemed that some encounter
impended. &#8220;Ye&#8217;re an unkind man,&#8221; says he, in a
passionless way, to the gray stranger, who was now
once more seated at his desk, fingering the litter of
documents. &#8220;Ye&#8217;ve broke your word t&#8217; me. I must
punish ye for the evil ye&#8217;ve done this lad. I&#8217;ll not ask
ye what ye&#8217;ve told un till I haves my way with ye; but
then,&#8221; he declared, his voice betraying a tremor of indignation,
&#8220;I&#8217;ll have the talk out o&#8217; ye, word for word!&#8221;
The gray stranger was agitated, but would not look up
from his aimlessly wandering hand to meet my uncle&#8217;s
lowering, reproachful eyes. &#8220;Dannie,&#8221; says my uncle,
continuing in gentle speech, &#8220;pass the cushion from the
big chair. Thank &#8217;e, lad. I&#8217;m not wantin&#8217; the man t&#8217;
hurt his head.&#8221; He cast the cushion to the floor.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
&#8220;Now, sir,&#8221; says he, gently, &#8220;an ye&#8217;ll be good enough
t&#8217; step within five-foot-ten o&#8217; that there red cushion, I&#8217;ll
knock ye down an&#8217; have it over with.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man looked sullenly out of the window.</p>
<p>&#8220;Five-foot-ten, sir,&#8221; my uncle repeated, with some
cheerfulness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Top,&#8221; was the vicious response, &#8220;you invite assassination.&#8221;</p>
<p>My uncle put his hand on my shoulder. &#8220;&#8217;Tis not
fit for ye t&#8217; see, lad,&#8221; says he. &#8220;Ye&#8217;d best be off t&#8217;
the fresh air. &#8217;Tis so wonderful stuffy here that ye&#8217;ll
be growin&#8217; pale an ye don&#8217;t look out. An&#8217; I&#8217;m not
wantin&#8217; ye t&#8217; see me knock a man down,&#8221; he repeated,
with feeling. &#8220;I&#8217;m not wantin&#8217; ye even t&#8217; <i>think</i> that
I&#8217;d do an unkind thing like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>I moved to go.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, sir!&#8221; cries my uncle to the stranger.</p>
<p>As I closed the door behind me the man was passing
with snarling lips to the precise spot my uncle had
indicated....</p>

<h3>NO APOLOGY</h3>
</div>
<p>My uncle knocked on my door at the hotel and,
without waiting to be bidden, thrust in his great,
red, bristling, monstrously scarred head. &#8217;Twas an intrusion
most diffident and fearful: he was like a mischievous
boy come for chastisement.</p>
<p>&#8220;You here, Dannie?&#8221; he gently inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in, sir,&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas awkwardly&ndash;&ndash;with a bashful grin and halting,
doubtful step&ndash;&ndash;that he stumped in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Comfortable?&#8221; he asked, looking about. &#8220;No complaint
t&#8217; make ag&#8217;in this here hotel?&#8221;</p>
<p>I had no complaint.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not troubled, is you?&#8221;</p>
<p>I was not troubled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t bothered, is you?&#8221; he pursued, with an inviting
wink. &#8220;Not bothered about nothin&#8217;, lad, is you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nor bothered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come now!&#8221; cries he, dissembling great candor and
heartiness, &#8220;is you got any questions t&#8217; ask ol&#8217; Nick
Top?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; I answered, quite confidently.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Dannie, lad,&#8221; says my uncle, unable to contain his
delight, with which, indeed, his little eyes brimmed over,
&#8220;an ye&#8217;d jus&#8217; be so damned good as t&#8217; tweak that
there&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>I pulled the bell-cord.</p>
<p>&#8220;A nip o&#8217; the best Jamaica,&#8221; says he.</p>
<p>Old Elihu Wall fetched the red dram.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lad,&#8221; says my uncle, his glass aloft, his eyes resting
upon me in pride, his voice athrill with passionate conviction,
&#8220;here&#8217;s t&#8217; <i>you</i>! That&#8217;s good o&#8217; you,&#8221; says he.
&#8220;That&#8217;s very good. I &#8217;low I&#8217;ve fetched ye up very well.
Ecod!&#8221; he swore, with most reverent and gentle intention,
&#8220;ye&#8217;ll be a gentleman afore ye knows it!&#8221;</p>
<p>He downed the liquor with a grin that came over his
lurid countenance like a burst of low sunshine.</p>
<p>&#8220;A gentleman,&#8221; he repeated, &#8220;in spite o&#8217; Chesterfield!&#8221;</p>
<p>When my uncle was gone, I commanded my reflections
elsewhere, prohibited by honor from dwelling upon
the wretched mystery in which I was enmeshed. They
ran with me to the fool of Twist Tickle. The weather
had turned foul: &#8217;twas blowing up from the north in a
way to make housed folk shiver for their fellows at sea.
Evil sailing on the Labrador! I wondered how the
gentle weakling fared as cook of the <i>Quick as Wink</i>. I
wondered in what harbor he lay, in the blustering night,
or off what coast he tossed. I wondered what trouble
he had within his heart. I wished him home again:
but yet remembered, with some rising of hope, that his
amazing legacy of wisdom had in all things been sufficient
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
to his need. Had he not in peace and usefulness
walked the paths of the world where wiser folk had gone
with bleeding feet? &#8217;Twas dwelling gratefully upon
this miracle of wisdom and love, a fool&#8217;s inheritance,
that I, who had no riches of that kind, fell asleep, without
envy or perturbation, that night.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&#8217;Twas not long I had to wait to discover the fortune
of the fool upon that voyage. We were not three days
returned from the city when the <i>Quick as Wink</i> slipped
into our harbor. She had been beating up all afternoon;
&#8217;twas late of a dark night when she dropped
anchor. John Cather was turned in, Judith long ago
whisked off to bed by our maid-servant; my uncle and
I sat alone together when the rattle of the chain apprised
us that the schooner was in the shelter of the Lost
Soul.</p>
<p>By-and-by Moses came.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been long on the road,&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Dannie,&#8221; he explained, looking at his cap,
which he was awkwardly twirling, &#8220;I sort o&#8217; fell in with
Parson Stump by the way, an&#8217; stopped for a bit of a
gossip.&#8221;</p>
<p>I begged him to sit with us.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; says he; &#8220;but I&#8217;m &#8217;bliged t&#8217; you. Fac&#8217; is,
Dannie,&#8221; says he, gravely, &#8220;I isn&#8217;t got time.&#8221;</p>
<p>My uncle was amazed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve quit the ship,&#8221; Moses went on, &#8220;not bein&#8217; much
of a hand at cookin&#8217;. I&#8217;ll be t&#8217; home now,&#8221; says he,
&#8220;an&#8217; I&#8217;d be glad t&#8217; have you an&#8217; Skipper Nicholas
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
drop in, some day soon, when you&#8217;re passin&#8217; Whisper
Cove.&#8221;</p>
<p>We watched him twirl his cap.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d find a wonderful warm welcome,&#8221; says he,
&#8220;from Mrs. Moses Shoos!&#8221;</p>
<p>With that he was gone.</p>

<h3>FOOL&#8217;S FORTUNE</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Close the door, Dannie,&#8221; says Tumm, in the
little cabin of the <i>Quick as Wink</i>, late that night,
when the goods were put to rights, and the bottle was
on the counter, and the schooner was nodding sleepily
in the spent waves from the open sea. &#8220;This here
yarn o&#8217; the weddin&#8217; o&#8217; Moses Shoos is not good for everybody
t&#8217; hear.&#8221; He filled the glasses&ndash;&ndash;chuckling all the
time deep in his chest. &#8220;We was reachin&#8217; up t&#8217; Whoopin&#8217;
Harbor,&#8221; he began, being a great hand at a story, &#8220;t&#8217;
give the <i>Quick as Wink</i> a night&#8217;s lodgin&#8217;, it bein&#8217; a
wonderful windish night; clear enough, the moon sailin&#8217;
a cloudy sky, but with a bank o&#8217; fog sneakin&#8217; round
Cape Muggy like a fish-thief. An&#8217; we wasn&#8217;t in no
haste, anyhow, t&#8217; make Sinners&#8217; Tickle, for we was the
first trader down this season, an&#8217; &#8217;twas pick an&#8217; choose
for we, with a clean bill t&#8217; every harbor from Starvation
Cove t&#8217; the Settin&#8217; Hen. So the skipper he says we&#8217;ll
hang the ol&#8217; girl up t&#8217; Whoopin&#8217; Harbor &#8217;til dawn; an&#8217;
we&#8217;ll all have a watch below, says he, with a cup o&#8217; tea,
says he, if the cook can bile the water &#8217;ithout burnin&#8217; it.
Now, look you! Saucy Bill North is wonderful fond
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
of his little joke; an&#8217; &#8217;twas this here habit o&#8217; burnin&#8217; the
water he&#8217;d pitched on t&#8217; plague the poor cook with,
since we put out o&#8217; Twist Tickle on the v&#8217;y&#8217;ge
down.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Cook, you dunderhead!&#8217; says the skipper, with a
wink t&#8217; the crew, which I was sorry t&#8217; see, &#8216;you been an&#8217;
scarched the water agin.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shoos he looked like he&#8217;d give up for good on the
spot&ndash;&ndash;just like he <i>knowed</i> he was a fool, an&#8217; <i>had</i> knowed
it for a long, long time&ndash;&ndash;sort o&#8217; like he was sorry for we
an&#8217; sick of hisself.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Cook,&#8217; says the skipper, &#8216;you went an&#8217; done it agin.
Yes, you did! Don&#8217;t you go denyin&#8217; of it. You&#8217;ll kill
us, cook,&#8217; says he, &#8216;if you goes on like this. They isn&#8217;t
nothin&#8217; worse for the system,&#8217; says he, &#8216;than this here
burned water. The almanacs,&#8217; says he, shakin&#8217; his
finger at the poor cook, &#8216;&#8217;ll tell you <i>that!</i>&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I &#8217;low I did burn that water, skipper,&#8217; says the
cook, &#8216;if you says so. But I isn&#8217;t got all my wits,&#8217; says
he; &#8217;an&#8217; God knows I&#8217;m doin&#8217; my best!&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I always did allow, cook,&#8217; says the skipper, &#8216;that
God knowed more&#8217;n I ever thunk.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;An&#8217; I never <i>did</i> burn no water,&#8217; says the cook,
&#8216;afore I shipped along o&#8217; you in this here ol&#8217; flour-sieve
of a <i>Quick as Wink.</i>&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;This here <i>what?</i>&#8217; snaps the skipper.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;This here ol&#8217; basket,&#8217; says the cook.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Basket!&#8217; says the skipper. Then he hummed a bit
o&#8217; &#8216;Fishin&#8217; for the Maid I Loves,&#8217; &#8217;ithout thinkin&#8217; much
about the toon. &#8216;Cook,&#8217; says he &#8216;I loves you. You is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
on&#8217;y a half-witted chance-child,&#8217; says he, &#8216;but I loves
you like a brother.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Does you, skipper?&#8217; says the cook, with a nice, soft
little smile, like the poor fool he was. &#8216;I isn&#8217;t by no
means hatin&#8217; you, skipper,&#8217; says he. &#8216;But I can&#8217;t <i>help</i>
burnin&#8217; the water,&#8217; says he, &#8216;an&#8217; I &#8217;low it fair hurts me
t&#8217; get blame for it. I&#8217;m sorry for you an&#8217; the crew,&#8217;
says he, &#8216;an&#8217; I wisht I hadn&#8217;t took the berth. But when
I shipped along o&#8217; you,&#8217; says he, &#8216;I &#8217;lowed I <i>could</i> cook,
for mother always told me so, an&#8217; I &#8217;lowed she knowed.
I&#8217;m doin&#8217; my best, anyhow, accordin&#8217; t&#8217; how she&#8217;d have
me do, an&#8217; I &#8217;low if the water gets scarched,&#8217; says he,
&#8216;the galley fire&#8217;s bewitched.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Basket!&#8217; says the skipper. &#8216;Ay, ay, cook,&#8217; says he.
&#8216;I just <i>loves</i> you.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;They wasn&#8217;t a man o&#8217; the crew liked t&#8217; hear the
skipper say that; for, look you! the skipper doesn&#8217;t
know nothin&#8217; about feelin&#8217;s, an&#8217; the cook has more
feelin&#8217;s &#8217;n a fool can make handy use of aboard a tradin&#8217;
craft. There sits the ol&#8217; man, smoothin&#8217; his big, red
beard, singin&#8217; &#8216;I&#8217;m Fishin&#8217; for the Maid I Loves,&#8217; while
he looks at poor Moses Shoos, which was washin&#8217; up
the dishes, for we was through with the mug-up. An&#8217;
the devil was in his eyes&ndash;&ndash;the devil was fair grinnin&#8217; in
them little blue eyes. Lord! it made me sad t&#8217; see it,
for I knowed the cook was in for bad weather, an&#8217; he
isn&#8217;t no sort o&#8217; craft t&#8217; be out o&#8217; harbor in a gale o&#8217;
wind like that.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Cook,&#8217; says the skipper.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Ay, sir?&#8217; says the cook.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span></div>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Cook,&#8217; says the skipper, &#8216;you ought t&#8217; get married.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I on&#8217;y wisht I could,&#8217; says the cook.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;You ought t&#8217; try, cook,&#8217; says the skipper, &#8216;for the
sake o&#8217; the crew. We&#8217;ll all die,&#8217; says he, &#8216;afore we
sights ol&#8217; Bully Dick agin,&#8217; says he, &#8216;if you keeps on
burnin&#8217; the water. You <i>got</i> t&#8217; get married, cook, t&#8217; the
first likely maid you sees on the Labrador,&#8217; says he, &#8216;t&#8217;
save the crew. She&#8217;d do the cookin&#8217; for you. It&#8217;ll be
the loss o&#8217; all hands,&#8217; says he, &#8216;an you don&#8217;t. This here
burned water,&#8217; says he, &#8216;will be the end of us, cook, an
you keeps it up.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;d be wonderful glad t&#8217; &#8217;blige you, skipper,&#8217; says
the cook, &#8216;an&#8217; I&#8217;d like t&#8217; &#8217;blige all hands. &#8217;Twon&#8217;t be
by my wish,&#8217; says he, &#8216;that anybody&#8217;ll die o&#8217; the grub
they gets, for mother wouldn&#8217;t like it.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Cook,&#8217; says the skipper, &#8216;shake! I knows a <i>man,</i>&#8217;
says he, &#8216;when I sees one. Any man,&#8217; says he, &#8216;that
would put on the irons o&#8217; matrimony,&#8217; says he, &#8216;t&#8217; &#8217;blige
a shipmate,&#8217; says he, &#8216;is a better man &#8217;n me, an&#8217; I loves
un like a brother.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;The cook was cheered up considerable.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Cook,&#8217; says the skipper, &#8216;I &#8217;pologize. Yes, I do,
cook,&#8217; says he, &#8216;I &#8217;pologize.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I isn&#8217;t got no feelin&#8217; ag&#8217;in&#8217; matrimony,&#8217; says the
cook. &#8216;But I isn&#8217;t able t&#8217; get took. I been tryin&#8217; every
maid t&#8217; Twist Tickle,&#8217; says he, &#8216;an&#8217; they isn&#8217;t one,&#8217; says
he, &#8216;will wed a fool.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Not <i>one</i> maid t&#8217; wed a fool!&#8217; says the skipper.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Nar a one,&#8217; says the cook.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;m s&#8217;prised,&#8217; says the skipper.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span></div>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Nar a maid t&#8217; Twist Tickle,&#8217; says the cook, &#8216;will
wed a fool, an&#8217; I &#8217;low they isn&#8217;t one,&#8217; says he, &#8216;on the
Labrador.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;It&#8217;s been done afore, cook,&#8217; says the skipper, &#8216;an&#8217;
I &#8217;low &#8217;twill be done agin, if the world don&#8217;t come to
an end t&#8217; oncet. Cook,&#8217; says he, &#8216;I <i>knows</i> the maid t&#8217;
do it.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;d be wonderful glad t&#8217; find <i>she</i>,&#8217; says the cook.
&#8216;Mother,&#8217; says he, &#8216;always &#8217;lowed a man didn&#8217;t ought
t&#8217; live alone.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Ay, b&#8217;y,&#8217; says the skipper, &#8216;I got the girl for <i>you</i>.
An&#8217; she isn&#8217;t a thousand miles,&#8217; says he, &#8216;from where
that ol&#8217; basket of a <i>Quick as Wink</i> lies at anchor,&#8217; says
he, &#8216;in Whoopin&#8217; Harbor. She isn&#8217;t what you&#8217;d call
handsome an&#8217; tell no lie,&#8217; says he, &#8216;but&ndash;&ndash;&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Never you mind about that, skipper,&#8217; says the cook.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;No,&#8217; says the skipper, &#8216;she isn&#8217;t handsome, as handsome
goes, even in these parts, but&ndash;&ndash;&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Never you mind, skipper,&#8217; says the cook: &#8216;for
mother always &#8217;lowed that looks come off in the first
washin&#8217;.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I &#8217;low that Liz Jones would take you, cook,&#8217; says
the skipper. &#8216;You ain&#8217;t much on wits, but you got a
good-lookin&#8217; figure-head; an&#8217; I &#8217;low she&#8217;d be more&#8217;n
willin&#8217; t&#8217; skipper a craft like you. You better go
ashore, cook, when you gets cleaned up, an&#8217; see what
she says. Tumm,&#8217; says he, &#8216;is sort o&#8217; shipmates with
Liz,&#8217; says he, &#8216;an&#8217; I &#8217;low he&#8217;ll see you through the worst
of it.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Will you, Tumm?&#8217; says the cook.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span></div>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well,&#8217; says I, &#8216;I&#8217;ll see.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;I knowed Liz Jones from the time I fished Whoopin&#8217;
Harbor with Skipper Bill Topsail in the <i>Love the Wind</i>,
bein&#8217; cotched by the measles thereabouts, which she
nursed me through; an&#8217; I &#8217;lowed she <i>would</i> wed the
cook if he asked her, so, thinks I, I&#8217;ll go ashore with
the fool t&#8217; see that she don&#8217;t. No; she isn&#8217;t handsome&ndash;&ndash;not
Liz. I&#8217;m wonderful fond o&#8217; yarnin&#8217; o&#8217; good-lookin&#8217;
maids, as you knows, Skipper Nicholas, sir; but
I can&#8217;t say much o&#8217; Liz: for Liz is so far t&#8217; l&#8217;eward o&#8217;
beauty that many a time, lyin&#8217; sick there in the fo&#8217;c&#8217;s&#8217;le
o&#8217; the <i>Love the Wind</i>, I wished the poor girl would turn
inside out, for, thinks I, the pattern might be a sight
better on the other side. I <i>will</i> say she is big and
well-muscled; an&#8217; muscles, t&#8217; my mind, counts enough
t&#8217; make up for black eyes, but not for cross-eyes, much
less for fuzzy whiskers. It ain&#8217;t in my heart t&#8217; make
sport o&#8217; Liz; but I <i>will</i> say she has a bad foot, for she
was born in a gale, I&#8217;m told, when the <i>Preacher</i> was
hangin&#8217; on off a lee shore &#8217;long about Cape Harrigan,
an&#8217; the sea was raisin&#8217; the devil. An&#8217;, well&ndash;&ndash;I hates t&#8217;
say it, but&ndash;&ndash;well, they call her &#8216;Walrus Liz.&#8217; No; she
isn&#8217;t handsome, she haven&#8217;t got no good looks; but once
you gets a look into whichever one o&#8217; them cross-eyes
you is able to cotch, you see a deal more&#8217;n your own
face; an&#8217; she <i>is</i> well-muscled, an&#8217; I &#8217;low I&#8217;m goin&#8217; t&#8217; tell
you so, for I wants t&#8217; name her good p&#8217;ints so well as her
bad. Whatever&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Cook,&#8217; says I, &#8216;I&#8217;ll go along o&#8217; you.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;With that Moses Shoos fell to on the dishes, an&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
&#8217;twasn&#8217;t long afore he was ready to clean hisself; which
done, he was ready for the courtin&#8217;. But first he got
out his dunny-bag, an&#8217; he fished in there &#8217;til he pulled
out a blue stockin&#8217;, tied in a hard knot; an&#8217; from the
toe o&#8217; that there blue stockin&#8217; he took a brass ring.
&#8216;I &#8217;low,&#8217;
says he, talkin&#8217; to hisself, in the half-witted way he has,
&#8216;it won&#8217;t do no hurt t&#8217; give her mother&#8217;s ring.
&#8220;Moses,&#8221; says mother,
&#8220;you better take the ring off my finger. It isn&#8217;t no weddin&#8217;-ring,&#8221; says she,
&#8220;for I never was what you might call wed by a real parson in the fashionable way, but on&#8217;y accordin&#8217; t&#8217; the customs o&#8217; the land,&#8221; says she,
&#8220;an&#8217; I got it from the Jew t&#8217; make believe I was wed in the way they does it in these days; for it didn&#8217;t do nobody no hurt, an&#8217; it sort o&#8217; pleased me. You better take it, Moses, b&#8217;y,&#8221; says she,
&#8220;for the dirt o&#8217; the grave would only spile it,&#8221; says she,
&#8220;an&#8217; I&#8217;m not wantin&#8217; it no more. Don&#8217;t wear it at the fishin&#8217;, dear,&#8221; says she,
&#8220;for the fishin&#8217; is wonderful hard,&#8221; says she,
&#8220;an&#8217; joolery don&#8217;t stand much wear an&#8217; tear.&#8221;
&#8216;Oh, mother!&#8217; says the cook,
&#8216;I done what you wanted!&#8217;
Then the poor fool sighed an&#8217; looked up at the skipper.
&#8216;I &#8217;low, skipper,&#8217; says he,
&#8216;&#8217;twouldn&#8217;t do no hurt t&#8217; give the ring to a man&#8217;s wife, would it? For mother wouldn&#8217;t mind, would she?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;The skipper didn&#8217;t answer that.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Come, cook,&#8217; says I, &#8216;leave us get under way,&#8217; for
I couldn&#8217;t stand it no longer.</p>
<p>&#8220;So the cook an&#8217; me put out in the punt t&#8217; land at
Whoopin&#8217; Harbor, with the crew wishin&#8217; the poor cook
well with their lips, but thinkin&#8217;, God knows what! in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
their hearts. An&#8217; he was in a wonderful state o&#8217; fright.
I never <i>seed</i> a man so took by scare afore. For, look
you! poor Moses thinks she might have un. &#8216;I never
had half a chance afore,&#8217; says he. &#8216;They&#8217;ve all declined
in a wonderful regular way. But now,&#8217; says he,
&#8216;I &#8217;low I&#8217;ll be took. I jus&#8217; <i>feels</i> that way; an&#8217;, Tumm,
I&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m scared!&#8217; I cheered un up so well as I could;
an&#8217; by-an&#8217;-by we was on the path t&#8217; Liz Jones&#8217;s house,
up on Gray Hill, where she lived alone, her mother bein&#8217;
dead an&#8217; her father shipped on a bark from St. John&#8217;s
t&#8217; the West Indies. An&#8217; we found Liz sittin&#8217; on a rock
at the turn o&#8217; the road, lookin&#8217; down from the hill at the
<i>Quick as Wink</i>; all alone&ndash;&ndash;sittin&#8217; there in the moonlight,
all alone&ndash;&ndash;thinkin&#8217; o&#8217; God knows what!</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Hello, Liz!&#8217; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Hello, Tumm!&#8217; says she. &#8216;What vethel&#8217;th that?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;That&#8217;s the <i>Quick as Wink</i>, Liz,&#8217; says I. &#8216;An&#8217; here&#8217;s
the cook o&#8217; that there craft,&#8217; says I, &#8216;come up the hill t&#8217;
speak t&#8217; you.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;That&#8217;s right,&#8217; says the cook. &#8216;Tumm, you&#8217;re
right.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;T&#8217; thpeak t&#8217; <i>me</i>!&#8217; says she.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wisht she hadn&#8217;t spoke quite that way. Lord! it
wasn&#8217;t nice. It makes a man feel bad t&#8217; see a woman
put her hand on her heart for a little thing like
that.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Ay, Liz,&#8217; says I, &#8216;t&#8217; speak t&#8217; you. An&#8217; I&#8217;m thinkin&#8217;,
Liz,&#8217; says I, &#8216;he&#8217;ll say things no man ever said afore&ndash;&ndash;t&#8217;
you.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;That&#8217;s right, Tumm,&#8217; says the cook. &#8216;I wants t&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
speak as man t&#8217; man,&#8217; says he, &#8216;t&#8217; stand by what I says,&#8217;
says he, &#8216;accordin&#8217; as mother would have me do!&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Liz got off the rock. Then she begun t&#8217; kick at the
path; an&#8217; she was lookin&#8217; down, but I &#8217;lowed she had
an eye on Moses all the time. &#8216;For,&#8217; thinks I, &#8216;she&#8217;s
sensed the thing out, like all the women.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;m thinkin&#8217;,&#8217; says I, &#8216;I&#8217;ll go up the road a bit.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Oh no, you won&#8217;t, Tumm,&#8217; says she. &#8216;You thtay
right here. Whath the cook wantin&#8217; o&#8217; me?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well,&#8217; says the cook, &#8216;I &#8217;low I wants t&#8217; get married.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;T&#8217; get married!&#8217; says she.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;T&#8217; get married,&#8217; says the cook, &#8216;accordin&#8217; as mother
would have me; an&#8217; I &#8217;low you&#8217;ll do.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Me?&#8217; says she.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Liz,&#8217; says he, as solemn as church, &#8216;I means you.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;It come to her all of a suddent&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; she begun t&#8217;
breathe hard, an&#8217; pressed her hands against her breast
an&#8217; shivered. But she looked away t&#8217; the moon, an&#8217;
somehow that righted her.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;You better thee me in daylight,&#8217; says she.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Don&#8217;t you mind about that,&#8217; says he. &#8216;Mother
always &#8217;lowed that sort o&#8217; thing didn&#8217;t matter: an&#8217; she
knowed.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;She put a finger under his chin an&#8217; tipped his face
t&#8217; the light.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;You ithn&#8217;t got all your thentheth, ith you?&#8217; says
she.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well,&#8217; says he, &#8216;bein&#8217; born on Hollow-eve,&#8217; says he,
&#8216;I <i>isn&#8217;t</i> quite got all my wits. But,&#8217; says he, &#8216;I wisht I

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I got mother&#8217;s ring,&#8217; says the cook, &#8216;t&#8217; prove it.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Tumm,&#8217; says Liz t&#8217; me, &#8216;<i>you</i> ithn&#8217;t wantin&#8217; t&#8217; get

<p>&#8220;&#8216;No,&#8217; says she. &#8216;Not&ndash;&ndash;t&#8217; me.&#8217; She took me round
the turn in the road. &#8216;Tumm,&#8217; says she, &#8216;I &#8217;low I&#8217;ll

Tumm,&#8217; says she, &#8216;no man ever afore athked me t&#8217;

boatht of. God made me,&#8217; says she, &#8216;an&#8217; I ithn&#8217;t mad
that He done it. I &#8217;low He meant me t&#8217; take the firth
man that come, an&#8217; be content. I &#8217;low <i>I</i> ithn&#8217;t got no
right t&#8217; thtick up my nothe at a fool. For, Tumm,&#8217; says
she, &#8216;God made that fool, too. An&#8217;, Tumm,&#8217; says she,

Ith&ndash;&ndash;&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;What you wantin&#8217;, Liz?&#8217; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;It ithn&#8217;t a man, Tumm,&#8217; says she.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;No?&#8217; says I. &#8216;What is it, Liz?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Ith a baby,&#8217; says she.</p>
<p>&#8220;God! I felt bad when she told me that....&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Tumm stopped, sighed, picked at a knot in the table.
There was silence in the cabin. The <i>Quick as Wink</i>
was still nodding to the swell&ndash;&ndash;lying safe at anchor in a
cove of Twist Tickle. We heard the gusts scamper over
the deck and shake the rigging; we caught, in the intervals,
the deep-throated roar of breakers, far off&ndash;&ndash;all
the noises of the gale. And Tumm picked at the knot
with his clasp-knife; and we sat watching, silent, all.
And I felt bad, too, because of the maid at Whooping
Harbor&ndash;&ndash;a rolling waste of rock, with the moonlight
lying on it, stretching from the whispering mystery of
the sea to the greater desolation beyond; and an uncomely
maid, alone and wistful, wishing, without hope,
for that which the hearts of women must ever desire....</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; Tumm drawled, &#8220;it made me feel bad t&#8217;
think o&#8217; what she&#8217;d been wantin&#8217; all them years; an&#8217;
then I wished I&#8217;d been kinder t&#8217; Liz.... An&#8217;, &#8216;Tumm,&#8217;
thinks I, &#8216;you went an&#8217; come ashore t&#8217; stop this here
thing; but you better let the skipper have his little joke,
for &#8217;twill on&#8217;y s&#8217;prise him, an&#8217; it won&#8217;t do nobody else
no hurt. Here&#8217;s this fool,&#8217; thinks I, &#8216;wantin&#8217; a wife;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
an&#8217; he won&#8217;t never have another chance. An&#8217; here&#8217;s
this maid,&#8217; thinks I, &#8216;wantin&#8217; a baby; an&#8217; <i>she</i> won&#8217;t
never have another chance. &#8217;Tis plain t&#8217; see,&#8217; thinks I,
&#8216;that God A&#8217;mighty, who made un, crossed their courses;
an&#8217; I &#8217;low, ecod!&#8217; thinks I, &#8216;that &#8217;twasn&#8217;t a bad idea He
had. If He&#8217;s got to get out of it somehow,&#8217; thinks I,
&#8216;why, <i>I</i> don&#8217;t know no better way. Tumm,&#8217; thinks I,
&#8216;you sheer off. Let Nature,&#8217; thinks I, &#8216;have course an&#8217;
be glorified.&#8217; So I looks Liz in the eye&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; says
nothin&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Tumm,&#8217; says she, &#8216;doth you think he&ndash;&ndash;&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Don&#8217;t you be scared o&#8217; nothin&#8217;,&#8217; says I. &#8216;He&#8217;s a
lad o&#8217; good feelin&#8217;s,&#8217; says I, &#8216;an&#8217; he&#8217;ll treat you the best
he knows how. Is you goin&#8217; t&#8217; take un?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I wathn&#8217;t thinkin&#8217; o&#8217; that,&#8217; says she. &#8216;I wathn&#8217;t
thinkin&#8217; o&#8217; <i>not</i>. I wath jutht,&#8217; says she, &#8216;wonderin&#8217;.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;They isn&#8217;t no sense in that, Liz,&#8217; says I. &#8216;You
just wait an&#8217; find out.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;What&#8217;th hith name?&#8217; says she.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Shoos,&#8217; says I. &#8216;Moses Shoos.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;With that she up with her pinny an&#8217; begun t&#8217; cry like
a young swile.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;What you cryin&#8217; for, Liz?&#8217; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;I &#8217;low I couldn&#8217;t tell what &#8217;twas all about. But she
was like all the women. Lord! &#8217;tis the little things that
makes un weep when it comes t&#8217; the weddin&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Come, Liz,&#8217; says I, &#8216;what you cryin&#8217; about?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I lithp,&#8217; says she.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I knows you does, Liz,&#8217; says I; &#8216;but it ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217;
t&#8217; cry about.&#8217;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span></div>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I can&#8217;t say Joneth,&#8217; says she.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;No,&#8217; says I; &#8216;but you&#8217;ll be changin&#8217; your name,&#8217;
says I, &#8216;an&#8217; it won&#8217;t matter no more.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;An&#8217; if I can&#8217;t say Joneth,&#8217; says she, &#8216;I can&#8217;t thay&ndash;&ndash;&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Can&#8217;t say what?&#8217; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Can&#8217;t thay Thooth!&#8217; says she.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord! No more she could. An&#8217; t&#8217; say Moses
Shoos! An&#8217; t&#8217; say Mrs. Moses Shoos! Lord! It give
me a pain in the tongue t&#8217; think of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Jutht my luck,&#8217; says she; &#8216;but I&#8217;ll do my betht.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;So we went back an&#8217; told poor Moses Shoos that he
didn&#8217;t have t&#8217; worry no more about gettin&#8217; a wife; an&#8217;
he said he was more glad than sorry, an&#8217;, says he, she&#8217;d
better get her bonnet, t&#8217; go aboard an&#8217; get married right
away. An&#8217; she &#8217;lowed she didn&#8217;t want no bonnet, but
<i>would</i> like to change her pinny. So we said we&#8217;d as lief
wait a spell, though a clean pinny wasn&#8217;t <i>needed</i>. An&#8217;
when she got back, the cook said he &#8217;lowed the skipper
could marry un well enough &#8217;til we overhauled a real
parson; an&#8217; she thought so, too, for, says she, &#8217;twouldn&#8217;t
be longer than a fortnight, an&#8217; <i>any</i> sort of a weddin&#8217;,
says she, would do &#8217;til then. An&#8217; aboard we went, the
cook an&#8217; me pullin&#8217; the punt, an&#8217; she steerin&#8217;; an&#8217; the
cook he crowed an&#8217; cackled all the way, like a half-witted
rooster; but the maid didn&#8217;t even cluck, for she
was too wonderful solemn t&#8217; do anything but look at the
moon.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Skipper,&#8217; said the cook, when we got in the fo&#8217;c&#8217;s&#8217;le,
&#8216;here she is. <i>I</i> isn&#8217;t afeared,&#8217; says he, &#8216;an&#8217; <i>she</i> isn&#8217;t
afeared; an&#8217; now I &#8217;lows we&#8217;ll have you marry us.&#8217;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Up jumps the skipper; but he was too much s&#8217;prised
t&#8217; say a word.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;An&#8217; I&#8217;m thinkin&#8217;,&#8217; says the cook, with a nasty little
wink, such as never I seed afore get into the eyes o&#8217;
Moses Shoos, &#8216;that they isn&#8217;t a man in this here fo&#8217;c&#8217;s&#8217;le,&#8217;
says he, &#8216;will <i>say</i> I&#8217;m afeared.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Cook,&#8217; says the skipper, takin&#8217; the cook&#8217;s hand,
&#8216;shake! I never knowed a man like you afore,&#8217; says
he. &#8216;T&#8217; my knowledge, you&#8217;re the on&#8217;y man in the
Labrador fleet would do it. I&#8217;m proud,&#8217; says he, &#8216;t&#8217;
take the hand o&#8217; the man with nerve enough t&#8217; marry
Walrus Liz o&#8217; Whoopin&#8217; Harbor.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;But &#8217;twas a new Moses he had t&#8217; deal with. The
devil got in the fool&#8217;s eyes&ndash;&ndash;a jumpin&#8217; little brimstone
devil, ecod! I never knowed the man could look that
way.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Ay, lad,&#8217; says the skipper, &#8216;I&#8217;m proud t&#8217; know the
man that isn&#8217;t afeared o&#8217; Walrus&ndash;&ndash;&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Don&#8217;t you call her that!&#8217; says the cook. &#8216;Don&#8217;t
you do it, skipper!&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was lookin&#8217; at Liz. She was grinnin&#8217; in a holy
sort o&#8217; way. Never seed nothin&#8217; like that afore&ndash;&ndash;no,
lads, not in all my life.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;An&#8217; why not, cook?&#8217; says the skipper.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;It ain&#8217;t her name,&#8217; says the cook.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;It ain&#8217;t?&#8217; says the skipper. &#8216;But I been sailin&#8217; the
Labrador for twenty year,&#8217; says he, &#8216;an&#8217; I &#8217;ain&#8217;t never
heared her called nothin&#8217; but Walrus&ndash;&ndash;&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Don&#8217;t you do it, skipper!&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;The devil got into the cook&#8217;s hands then. I seed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
his fingers clawin&#8217; the air in a hungry sort o&#8217; way. An&#8217;
it looked t&#8217; me like squally weather for the skipper.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Don&#8217;t you do it no more, skipper,&#8217; says the cook.
&#8216;I isn&#8217;t got no wits,&#8217; says he, an&#8217; I&#8217;m feelin&#8217; wonderful
queer!&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;The skipper took a look ahead into the cook&#8217;s eyes.
&#8216;Well, cook,&#8217; says he, &#8216;I &#8217;low,&#8217; says he, &#8216;I won&#8217;t.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Liz laughed&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; got close t&#8217; the fool from Twist
Tickle. An&#8217; I seed her touch his coat-tail, like as if she
loved it, but didn&#8217;t dast do no more.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;What you two goin&#8217; t&#8217; do?&#8217; says the skipper.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;We &#8217;lowed you&#8217;d marry us,&#8217; says the cook, &#8216;&#8217;til we
come across a parson.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I will,&#8217; says the skipper. &#8216;Stand up here,&#8217; says he.
&#8216;All hands stand up!&#8217; says he. &#8216;Tumm,&#8217; says he, &#8216;get
me the first Book you comes across.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;I got un a Book.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Now, Liz,&#8217; says he, &#8216;can you cook?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Fair t&#8217; middlin&#8217;,&#8217; says she. &#8216;I won&#8217;t lie.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twill do,&#8217; says he. &#8216;An&#8217; does you want t&#8217; get
married t&#8217; this here dam&#8217; fool?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;An it pleathe you,&#8217; says she.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Shoos,&#8217; says the skipper, &#8216;will you let this woman
do the cookin&#8217;?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well, skipper,&#8217; says the cook, &#8216;I will; for I don&#8217;t
want nobody t&#8217; die o&#8217; my cookin&#8217; on this here v&#8217;y&#8217;ge, an&#8217;
I <i>knows</i> that mother wouldn&#8217;t mind.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;An&#8217; will you keep out o&#8217; the galley?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I &#8217;low I&#8217;ll <i>have</i> to.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;An&#8217; look you! cook, is you sure&ndash;&ndash;is you <i>sure</i>,&#8217; says
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
the skipper, with a shudder, lookin&#8217; at the roof, &#8216;that
you wants t&#8217; marry this here&ndash;&ndash;&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Don&#8217;t you do it, skipper!&#8217; says the cook. &#8216;Don&#8217;t
you say that no more! By the Lord!&#8217; says he, &#8216;I&#8217;ll kill
you if you does!&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Is you sure,&#8217; says the skipper, &#8216;that you wants t&#8217;
marry this here&ndash;&ndash;woman?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I will.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well,&#8217; says the skipper, kissin&#8217; the Book, &#8216;I &#8217;low
me an&#8217; the crew don&#8217;t care; an&#8217; we can&#8217;t help it, anyhow.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;What about mother&#8217;s ring?&#8217; says the cook. &#8216;She
might&#8217;s well have that,&#8217; says he, &#8216;if she&#8217;s careful about
the wear an&#8217; tear. For joolery,&#8217; says he t&#8217; Liz, &#8216;don&#8217;t
stand it.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;It can&#8217;t do no harm,&#8217; says the skipper.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Ith we married, thkipper?&#8217; says Liz, when she got
the ring on.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well,&#8217; says the skipper, &#8216;I &#8217;low that knot&#8217;ll hold &#8217;til
we puts into Twist Tickle, where Parson Stump can
mend it, right under my eye. For,&#8217; says he, &#8216;I got a
rope&#8217;s-end an&#8217; a belayin&#8217;-pin t&#8217; <i>make</i> it hold,&#8217; says he,
&#8216;&#8217;til we gets &#8217;longside o&#8217; <i>some</i> parson that knows more
about matrimonial knots &#8217;n me. We&#8217;ll pick up your
goods, Liz,&#8217; says he, &#8216;on the s&#8217;uthard v&#8217;y&#8217;ge. An&#8217; I
hopes, ol&#8217; girl,&#8217; says he, &#8216;that you&#8217;ll be able t&#8217; boil the
water &#8217;ithout burnin&#8217; it.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Ay, Liz,&#8217; says the cook, &#8216;I been makin&#8217; a awful fist
o&#8217; b&#8217;ilin&#8217; the water o&#8217; late.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;She give him one look&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; put her clean pinny to
her eyes.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span></div>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;What you cryin&#8217; about?&#8217; says the cook.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I don&#8217;t know,&#8217; says she; &#8216;but I &#8217;low &#8217;tith becauthe
now I knowth you <i>ith</i> a fool!&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;She&#8217;s right, Tumm,&#8217; says the cook. &#8216;She&#8217;s got it
right! Bein&#8217; born on Hollow-eve,&#8217; says he, &#8216;I couldn&#8217;t
be nothin&#8217; else. But, Liz,&#8217; says he, &#8216;I&#8217;m glad I got you,
fool or no fool.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;So she wiped her eyes, an&#8217; blowed her nose, an&#8217; give
a little sniff, an&#8217; looked up an&#8217; smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I isn&#8217;t good enough for you,&#8217; says the poor cook.
&#8216;But, Liz,&#8217; says he, &#8216;if you kissed me,&#8217; says he, &#8216;I
wouldn&#8217;t mind a bit. An&#8217; they isn&#8217;t a man in this here
fo&#8217;c&#8217;s&#8217;le,&#8217; says he, lookin&#8217; round, &#8216;that&#8217;ll say I&#8217;d mind.
Not one,&#8217; says he, with the little devil jumpin&#8217; in his
eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then she stopped cryin&#8217; for good.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Go ahead, Liz!&#8217; says he. &#8216;I ain&#8217;t afeared. Come
on!&#8217; says he. &#8216;Give us a kiss!&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Motheth Thooth,&#8217; says she, &#8216;you&#8217;re the firtht man
ever athked me t&#8217; give un a kith!&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;She kissed un. &#8217;Twas like a pistol-shot. An&#8217;,
Lord! her poor face was shinin&#8217;....&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>In the cabin of the <i>Quick as Wink</i> we listened to the
wind as it scampered over the deck; and my uncle and
I watched Tumm pick at the knot in the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;He don&#8217;t <i>need</i> no sense,&#8221; said Tumm, looking up, at
last; &#8220;for he&#8217;ve <i>had</i> a mother, an&#8217; he&#8217;ve <i>got</i> a memory.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas very true, I thought.</p>

<h2>XXII</h2>
<h3>GATHERING WINDS</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8217;Twas by advice of Sir Harry, with meet attention
to the philosophy of Lord Chesterfield in respect
to the particular accomplishments essential to one who
would both please and rise in the world, that my uncle
commanded the grand tour to further my education and
to cure my twisted foot. &#8220;&#8217;Tis the last leg o&#8217; the beat,
lad;&#8221; he pleaded; &#8220;ye&#8217;ll be a gentleman, made t&#8217; order,
accordin&#8217; t&#8217; specifications, when &#8217;tis over with; an&#8217; I&#8217;ll
be wonderful glad,&#8221; says he, wearily, &#8220;when &#8217;tis done,
for I&#8217;ll miss ye sore, lad&ndash;&ndash;ecod! but I&#8217;ll miss ye sore.&#8221;
Abroad, then, despite the gray warning, went John
Cather and I, tutor and young gentleman, the twain not
to be distinguished from a company of high birth.
&#8217;Twas a ghastly thing: &#8217;twas a thing so unfit and
grotesque that I flush to think of it&ndash;&ndash;a thing, of all my
uncle&#8217;s benefits, I wish undone and cannot to this day
condone. But that implacable, most tender old ape,
when he bade us God-speed on the wharf, standing
with legs and staff triangularly disposed to steady him,
rippled with pride and admiration to observe the genteel
performance of our departure, and in the intervals of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
mopping his red, sweaty, tearful countenance, exhibited,
in unwitting caricature, the defiant consciousness of
station he had with infinite pains sought to have me
master.</p>
<p>&#8220;Made t&#8217; order, lad,&#8221; says he, at last, when he took
my hand, &#8220;accordin&#8217; t&#8217; the plans an&#8217; specifications o&#8217;
them that knows, an&#8217; quite regardless of expense.&#8221;</p>
<p>I patted him on the shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wisht,&#8221; says he, with a regretful wag, &#8220;that Tom
Callaway could see ye now. You an&#8217; your tooter! If
on&#8217;y Tom Callaway <i>could</i>! I bet ye &#8217;twould perk un
up a bit in the place he&#8217;s to! &#8217;Twould go a long way
towards distractin&#8217; his mind,&#8221; says he, &#8220;from the fire
an&#8217; fumes they talks so much about in church.&#8221;</p>
<p>You will be good enough to believe, if you please, that
there were sympathetic tears in my uncle&#8217;s eyes....</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Upon this misguided mission we were gone abroad
two years and a fortnight (deducting one day): and
pursuing it we travelled far. And we came to magnificent
cities, and beheld the places and things that are
written of in books, and ate of curious foods, and observed
many sorts of people and singular customs, and
fell in with strange companions, and sojourned in many
houses; but from the spectacle of the world I caught no
delight, nor won a lesson, nor gained in anything, save,
it may be, in knowledge of the book of my own heart.
As we went our way in new paths, my mind dwelt
continually with Judith, whom I loved; the vision of
her face, wistful and most fair in the mirage of Twist
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
Tickle, and the illusion of her voice, whispering from
the vacant world, were the realities of these wanderings&ndash;&ndash;the
people and palaces a fantasy. Of this I said
nothing to John Cather, who was himself cast down by
some obscure ailment of the spirit, so that I would not
add to his melancholy with my love-sickness, but rather
sought by cheerful behavior to mitigate the circumstances
of his sighs, which I managed not at all. And
having journeyed far in this unhappy wise, we came
again to the spacious sea and sky and clean air of Twist
Tickle, where Judith was with my uncle on the neck of
land by the Lost Soul, and the world returned to its
familiar guise of coast and ocean and free winds, and
the <i>Shining Light</i>, once more scraped and refitted
against the contingencies of my presence, awaited the
ultimate event in the placid waters of Old Wives&#8217;
Cove....</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Judith was grown to womanly age and ways and
perfected in every maidenly attraction. When she
came shyly from the shadows of the house into the
glowing sunset and spring weather of our landing, I
stopped, amazed, in the gravelled walk of our garden,
because of the incredible beauty of the maid, now first
revealed in bloom, and because of her modesty, which
was yet slyly aglint with coquetry, and because of the
tender gravity of her years, disclosed in the first poignant
search of the soul I had brought back from my
long journeying. I thought, I recall, at the moment of
our meeting, that laboring in a mood of highest exaltation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
God had of the common clay fashioned a glory of
person unsuspected of the eager, evil world out of which
I had come: I rejoiced, I know, that He had in this
bleak remoteness hidden it from the eyes of the world.
I fancied as she came&ndash;&ndash;&#8217;twas all in a flash&ndash;&ndash;that into
this rare creation He had breathed a spirit harmonious
with the afflatus of its conception. And being thus
overcome and preoccupied, I left the maid&#8217;s coy lips
escape me, but kissed her long, slender-fingered hand,
which she withdrew, at once, to give to John Cather,
who was most warm and voluble in greeting. I was by
this hurt; but John Cather was differently affected: it
seemed he did not care. He must be off to the hills,
says he, and he must go alone, instantly, at the peril
of his composure, to dwell with his mind, says he, upon
the thoughts that most elevated and gratified him. I
watched him off upon the Whisper Cove road with
improper satisfaction, for, thinks I, most ungenerously,
I might now, without the embarrassment of his presence,
which she had hitherto rejected, possess Judith&#8217;s
lips; but the maid was shy and perverse, and would
have none of it, apprising me sweetly of her determination.</p>
<p>By this I was again offended.</p>
<p>&#8220;Judy,&#8221; says my uncle, when we were within, &#8220;fetch
the bottle. Fetch the bottle, maid!&#8221; cries he; &#8220;for &#8217;tis
surely an occasion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Judith went to the pantry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dannie,&#8221; my uncle inquired, leaning eagerly close
when she was gone from the room, &#8220;is ye been good?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span></div>
<p>&#8217;Twas a question put in anxious doubt: I hesitated&ndash;&ndash;wondering
whether or not I had been good.</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t ye?&#8221; says he. &#8220;Ye&#8217;ll tell <i>me</i>, won&#8217;t ye? I&#8217;ll
love ye none the less for the evil ye&#8217;ve done.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still I could not answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been wantin&#8217; t&#8217; know,&#8221; says he, his three-fingered
fist softly beating the table, shaking in an intense
agitation of suspense. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been waitin&#8217; an&#8217;
waitin&#8217; for months&ndash;&ndash;jus&#8217; t&#8217; hear ye say!&#8221;</p>
<p>I was conscious of no evil accomplished.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye&#8217;ve a eye, Dannie!&#8221; says he.</p>
<p>I exposed my soul.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good,&#8221; says he, emphatically; &#8220;that&#8217;s very
good. I &#8217;low I&#8217;ve fetched ye up very well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Judith came with the bottle and little brown jug: she
had displaced me from this occupation.</p>
<p>&#8220;O&#8217; course,&#8221; says my uncle, in somewhat doubtful
and ungenerous invitation, &#8220;ye&#8217;ll be havin&#8217; a little darn
ol&#8217; rum with a ol&#8217; shipmate. Ye&#8217;ve doubtless learned
manners abroad,&#8221; says he.</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas a delight to hear the fond fellow tempt me
against his will: I smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jus&#8217; a little darn, Dannie,&#8221; he repeated, but in no
convivial way. &#8220;Jus&#8217; a little nip&ndash;&ndash;with a ol&#8217; shipmate?&#8221;</p>
<p>I laughed most heartily to see Judith&#8217;s sisterly concern
for me.</p>
<p>&#8220;A wee drop?&#8221; my uncle insisted, more confidently.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not used to it, sir,&#8221; says I.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span></div>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good,&#8221; he declared; &#8220;that&#8217;s very good. Give
the devil his due, Dannie: I&#8217;ve fetched ye up very
well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas with delight he challenged a disputation....</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>After this ceremony I sat with Judith on the peak of
the Lost Soul. My uncle paced the gravelled walk, in
the gathering dusk below, whence, by an ancient courtesy,
he might benignantly spy upon the love-making.
We were definite against the lingering twilight: I smiled
to catch the old man pausing in the path with legs spread
wide and glowing face upturned. But I had no smile
for the maid, poor child! nor any word to say, save only
to express a tenderness it seemed she would not hear.
&#8217;Twas very still in the world: there was no wind stirring,
no ripple upon the darkening water, no step on the
roads, no creak of oar-withe, no call or cry or laugh of
humankind, no echo anywhere; and the sunset clouds
trooped up from the rim of the sea with ominous stealth,
throwing off their garments of light as they came, advancing,
grim and gray, upon the shadowy coast.
Across the droch, lifted high above the maid and me,
his slender figure black against the pale-green sky,
stood John Cather on the brink of Tom Tulk&#8217;s cliff,
with arms extended in some ecstasy to the smouldering
western fire. A star twinkled serenely in the depths of
space beyond, seeming, in the mystery of that time, to
be set above his forehead; and I was pleased to fancy,
I recall, that &#8217;twas a symbol and omen of his nobility.
Thus the maid and I: thus we four folk, who played
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
the simple comedy&ndash;&ndash;unknowing, every one, in the departing
twilight of that day.</p>
<p>I reproached the maid. &#8220;Judith,&#8221; says I, &#8220;you&#8217;ve
little enough, it seems, to say to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is nothing,&#8221; she murmured, &#8220;for a maid to
say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is much,&#8221; I chided, &#8220;for a man to hear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never a word, Dannie, lad,&#8221; she repeated, &#8220;that a
maid may tell.&#8221;</p>
<p>I turned away.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a word,&#8221; says she, her voice fallen low and
very sweet, soft as the evening light about us, &#8220;that a
lad might speak.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what&#8217;s that, Judith?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis a riddle,&#8221; she answered; &#8220;and I fear, poor
child!&#8221; says she, compassionately, &#8220;that you&#8217;ll find it
hard to rede.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas unkind, I thought, to play with me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Dannie, child!&#8221; she sighed, a bit wounded and
rebuffed, it seems to me now, for she smiled in a way
more sad and tenderly reproachful than anything, as
she looked away, in a muse, to the fading colors in the
west. &#8220;Ah, Dannie,&#8221; she repeated, her face grown
grave and wistful, &#8220;you&#8217;ve come back the same as you
went away. Ye&#8217;ve come back,&#8221; says she, with a brief
little chuckle of gratification, &#8220;jus&#8217; the same!&#8221;</p>
<p>I thrust out my foot: she would not look at it.</p>
<p>&#8220;The self-same Dannie,&#8221; says she, her eyes steadfastly
averted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve <i>not</i>!&#8221; I cried, indignantly. That the maid
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
should so flout my new, proud walk! &#8217;Twas a bitter
reward: I remembered the long agony I had suffered
to please her. &#8220;I&#8217;ve <i>not</i> come back the same,&#8221; says I.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve come back changed. Have you not seen my
foot?&#8221; I demanded. &#8220;Look, maid!&#8221; I beat the rock
in a passion with that new foot of mine&ndash;&ndash;straight and
sound and capable for labor as the feet of other men.
It had all been done for her&ndash;&ndash;all borne to win the love
I had thought withheld, or stopped from fullest giving,
because of this miserable deformity. A maid is a maid,
I had known&ndash;&ndash;won as maids are won. &#8220;Look at it!&#8221;
cries I. &#8220;Is it the same as it was? Is it crooked any
more? Is it the foot of a man or a cripple?&#8221; She
would not look: but smiled into my eyes&ndash;&ndash;with a mist
of tears gathering within her own. &#8220;No,&#8221; I complained;
&#8220;you will not look. You would not look when I walked
up the path. I wanted you to look; but you would not.
You would not look when I put my foot on the table
before your very eyes. My uncle looked, and praised
me; but you would not look.&#8221; &#8217;Twas a frenzy of indignation
I had worked myself into by this time. I
could not see, any more, the silent glow of sunset color,
the brooding shadows, the rising masses of cloud, darkening
as they came: I have, indeed, forgotten, and
strangely so, the appearance of sea and sky at that
moment. &#8220;You would not look,&#8221; I accused the maid,
&#8220;when I leaped the brook. I leaped the brook as other
men may leap it; but you would not look. You would
not look when I climbed the hill. Who helped you up
the Lost Soul turn? Was it I? Never before did I do
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
it. All my life I have crawled that path. Was it the
club-footed young whelp who helped you?&#8221; I demanded.
&#8220;Was it that crawling, staggering, limping travesty
of the strength of men? But you do not care,&#8221; I complained.
&#8220;You do not care about my foot at all! Oh,
Judith,&#8221; I wailed, in uttermost agony, &#8220;you do not
care!&#8221;</p>
<p>I knew, then, looking far away into the sea and cloud
of the world, that the night was near.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; says she.</p>
<p>&#8220;Judith!&#8221; I implored. &#8220;Judith ... Judith!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; says she, &#8220;I cannot care.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just <i>say</i> you do,&#8221; I pleaded, &#8220;to save me pain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not tell you otherwise.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was near enough to feel her tremble&ndash;&ndash;to see her red
lips draw away, in stern conviction, from her white little
teeth.</p>
<p>&#8220;You do not care?&#8221; I asked her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not care.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas a shock to hear the words repeated. &#8220;Not
care!&#8221; I cried out.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not care,&#8221; says she, turning, all at once, from
the sullen crimson of the sky, to reproach me. &#8220;Why
should I care?&#8221; she demanded. &#8220;I have never cared&ndash;&ndash;never
cared&ndash;&ndash;about your foot!&#8221;</p>
<p>I should have adored her for this: but did not know
enough.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come!&#8221; says she, rising; &#8220;there is no sunset now.
&#8217;Tis all over with. The clouds have lost their glory.
There is nothing to see. Oh, Dannie, lad,&#8221; says
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
she&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;Dannie, boy, there is nothing here to see! We must
go home.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was cast down.</p>
<p>&#8220;No glory in the world!&#8221; says she.</p>
<p>&#8220;No light,&#8221; I sighed; &#8220;no light, at all, Judith, in this
gloomy place.&#8221;</p>
<p>And we went home....</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>For twelve days after that, while the skirt of winter
still trailed the world, the days being drear and gray,
with ice at sea and cold rain falling upon the hills, John
Cather kept watch on Judith and me. &#8217;Twas a close
and anxiously keen surveillance. &#8217;Twas, indeed, unremitting
and most daring, by night and day: &#8217;twas a
staring and peering and sly spying, &#8217;twas a lurking,
&#8217;twas a shy, not unfriendly, eavesdropping, an observation
without enmity or selfish purpose, ceasing not at
all, however, upon either, and most poignant when the
maid and I were left together, alone, as the wretched
man must have known, in the field of sudden junctures
of feeling. I remember his eyes&ndash;&ndash;dark eyes, inquiring
in a kindly way&ndash;&ndash;staring from the alders of the Whisper
Cove road, from the dripping hills, from the shadowy
places of our house: forever in anxious question upon
us. By this I was troubled, until, presently, I divined
the cause: the man was disquieted, thinks I, to observe
my happiness gone awry, but would not intrude even
so much as a finger upon the tangle of the lives of the
maid and me, because of the delicacy of his nature and
breeding. &#8217;Twas apparent, too, that he was ill: he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
would go white and red without cause, and did mope or
overflow with a feverish jollity, and would improperly
overfeed at table or starve his emaciating body. But
after a time, when he had watched us narrowly to his
heart&#8217;s content, he recovered his health and amiability,
and was the same as he had been. Judith and I were
then cold and distant in behavior with each other, but
unfailing in politeness: &#8217;twas now a settled attitude,
preserved by each towards the other, and betraying no
feeling of any sort whatever.</p>
<p>&#8220;John Cather,&#8221; says I, &#8220;you&#8217;ve been ill.&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed. &#8220;You are a dull fellow!&#8221; says he, in
his light way. &#8220;&#8217;Tis the penalty of honesty, I suppose;
and nature has fined you heavily. I have not been ill:
I have been troubled.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By what, John Cather?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I fancied,&#8221; he answered, putting his hands on my
shoulders, very gravely regarding me as he spoke, &#8220;that
I must sacrifice my hope. &#8217;Twas a hope I had long
cherished, Dannie, and was become like life to me.&#8221;
His voice was fallen deep and vibrant and soft; and
the feeling with which it trembled, and the light in the
man&#8217;s eyes, and the noble poise of his head, and the
dramatic arrangement of his sentences, so affected me
that I must look away. &#8220;Miserable necessity!&#8221; says
he. &#8220;A drear prospect! And with no more than a
sigh to ease the wretched fate! And yet,&#8221; says he,
quite heartily, &#8220;the thing had a pretty look to it.
Really, a beautiful look. There was a fine reward.
A good deed carries it. Always remember that, Dannie&ndash;&ndash;and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
remember that I told you. There was a fine
reward. No encouragement of applause, Dannie&ndash;&ndash;just
a long sigh in secret: then a grim age of self-command.
By jove! but there was a splendid compensation. A
compensation within myself, I mean&ndash;&ndash;a recollection of
at least one heroically unselfish act. There would have
been pain, of course; but I should never have forgotten
that I had played a man&#8217;s part&ndash;&ndash;better than a man&#8217;s
part: a hero&#8217;s part, a god&#8217;s part. And that might have
been sufficiently comforting: I do not know&ndash;&ndash;perhaps.
I&#8217;ll tell you about it, Dannie: the thing was to have
been done,&#8221; he explained, in sincere emotion, every
false appearance gone from him, &#8220;for whom, do you
think?&#8221;</p>
<p>I did not know.</p>
<p>&#8220;For a friend,&#8221; says he.</p>
<p>&#8220;But John Cather,&#8221; says I, &#8220;&#8217;twas too much to
require of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>His eyes twinkled.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve no trouble now, have you?&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not I!&#8221; cries he. &#8220;I have read a new fortune for
myself. Trouble? Not I! I am very happy, Dannie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good,&#8221; says I; &#8220;that&#8217;s very good!&#8221;</p>

<h2>XXIII</h2>
<h3>THE TIDE-RIP</h3>
</div>
<p>Next day &#8217;twas queer weather. &#8217;Twas weather
unaccountable, weather most mysteriously bent,
weather that laughed at our bewilderment, as though
&#8217;twere sure of wreaking its own will against us by some
trick recently devised. Never before had I known a
time so subtly, viciously, confidently to withhold its
omens. Queer weather, indeed! here, in early spring,
with drift-ice still coming in vast floes from the north,
queer weather to draw the sweat from us, while a midsummer
blue loom of the main-land hung high and
fantastically shaped in the thick air. Breathless, ominously
colored weather! Why, the like, for stillness and
beggarly expression of intention, had never been known
to Twist Tickle: they talked with indignation of it on
Eli Flack&#8217;s stage; &#8217;twas a day that bred wrecks, said
they. Ay, and &#8217;twas an outrage upon the poor fishermen
of that coast: what was a man to do, said they&ndash;&ndash;what
was he to do with his salmon-gear and cod-traps&ndash;&ndash;in
this evil, wilful departure from traditional procedure?
And what did the weather mean? would it blow wet or
dry? would it come with snow? would the wind jump
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
off shore or from the northeast? and how long, in the
name o&#8217; Heaven, would the weather sulk in distance
before breaking in honest wrath upon the coast? &#8217;Twas
enough, said they, to make a man quit the grounds;
&#8217;twas enough, with <i>this</i> sort o&#8217; thing keepin&#8217; up, t&#8217; make
a man turn carpenter or go t&#8217; Sydney!</p>
<p>All this I heard in passing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, well, lads,&#8221; says my uncle, &#8220;ye&#8217;ll find winter
skulkin&#8217; jus&#8217; over the horizon. An&#8217; he&#8217;ll be down,&#8221; he
added, confidently, &#8220;within a day or two.&#8221;</p>
<p>I led John Cather to the brink of Tom Tulk&#8217;s cliff,
where, in the smoky sunshine, I might talk in secret with
him. &#8217;Twas in my mind to confide my perplexity and
miserable condition of heart, without reserve of feeling
or mitigation of culpable behavior, and to lean upon
his wisdom and tactful arts for guidance into some
happier arrangement with the maid I loved. It seemed
to me, I recall, as I climbed the last slope, that I had
been, all my life, an impassive lover, as concerned the
welfare of the maid: that I had been ill-tempered and
unkind, marvellously quick to find offence, justified in
this cruel and stupid conduct by no admirable quality
or grace or achievement&ndash;&ndash;a lad demanding all for nothing.
I paused, I recall, at the cairn, to sigh, overcome
and appalled by this revelation; and thereupon I felt
such a rush of strenuous intention in my own behalf&ndash;&ndash;a
determination to strive and scheme&ndash;&ndash;that I had scarce
breath to reach the edge of the cliff, and could not, for
the life of me, begin to narrate my desperate state to
John Cather. But John Cather was not troubled by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
my silence: he was sprawled on the thick moss of the
cliff, his head propped in his hands, smiling, like the
alien he was, upon the ice at sea and the untimely blue
loom of the main-land and the vaguely threatening color
of the sky. I could not begin, wishful as I might be
for his wise counsel: but must lie, like a corpse, beyond
all feeling, contemplating that same uneasy prospect.
I wished, I recall, that I might utter my errand with
him, and to this day wish that I had been able: but then
could not, being overwhelmed by this new and convincing
vision of all my communion with the maid.</p>
<p>&#8220;By Jove!&#8221; John Cather ejaculated.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; cries I.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must tell you,&#8221; says he, rising to his elbow. &#8220;I
can keep it no longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>I waited.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in love,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;Dannie,&#8221; cries he, &#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m&ndash;&ndash;<i>in
love</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>And now a peculiar change came upon the world, of
which I must tell: whatever there had been of omen or
beauty or curious departure from the natural appearance
of sea and sky&ndash;&ndash;whatever of interest or moment
upon the brooding shore or abroad on the uttermost
waters beyond it&ndash;&ndash;quite vanished from my cognizance.
&#8217;Twas a drear day and place I dwelt in, a very dull
world, not enlivened by peril or desirable object or the
difficulty of toil, not excused or in any way made tolerable
by a prospect of sacrificial employment. I had been
ill brought up to meet this racking emergency. What
had there been, in all my life, fostered in body and happiness,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
expanding in the indulgent love and pitiably misdirected
purpose of my uncle, to fit me for this denial of
pure and confident desire? I tried, God knows I tried!
summoning to my help all the poor measure of nobility
the good Lord had endowed me with and my uncle had
cultivated&ndash;&ndash;I tried, God knows! to receive the communication
with some wish for my friend&#8217;s advancement
in happiness. In love: &#8217;twas with Judith&ndash;&ndash;there was
no other maid of Twist Tickle to be loved by this handsome,
learned, brilliantly engaging John Cather. Nay,
but &#8217;twas all plain to me now: my deformity and perversity&ndash;&ndash;my
ridiculously assured aspiration towards the
maid. I had forgot John Cather&ndash;&ndash;the youth and person
of him, his talents and winning accomplishments of
speech and manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;And there she comes!&#8221; cries he.</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas Judith on the Whisper Cove road.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll wish me luck, Dannie?&#8221; says he, rising.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll catch her on the way. I&#8217;ll tell her that I love her.
I can wait no longer. Wish me luck!&#8221; says he. &#8220;Wish
me luck!&#8221;</p>
<p>I took his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wish me luck!&#8221; he repeated.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you luck,&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; says he: and was off.</p>
<p>I lied in this way because I would not have Judith
know that I grieved for her, lest she suffer, in days to
come, for my disappointment....</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>I was faint and very thirsty, I recall: I wished that I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
might drink from a brook of snow-water. &#8217;Twas Calling
Brook I visualized, which flows from the melting
ice of cold, dark crevices, musically falling, beneath a
canopy of springing leaves, to the waters of Sister Bight.
I wished to drink from Calling Brook, and to lie down,
here alone and high above the sea, and to sleep, without
dreaming, for a long, long time. I lay me down on the
gray moss. I did not think of Judith and John Cather.
I had forgotten them: I was numb to the passion and
affairs of life. I suffered no agony of any sort; &#8217;twas
as though I had newly emerged from unconsciousness&ndash;&ndash;the
survivor of some natural catastrophe, fallen by act
of God, conveying no blame to me&ndash;&ndash;a survivor upon
whom there still lingered a beneficent stupor of body.
Presently I discovered myself in a new world, with
which, thinks I, brisking up, I must become familiar,
having no unmanly regret, but a courageous heart to
fare through the maze of it; and like a curious child I
peered about upon this strange habitation. Near by
there was a gray, weathered stone in the moss: I reached
to possess it&ndash;&ndash;and was amazed to find that my hand
neither overshot nor fell short, but accurately performed
its service. I cast the stone towards heaven: &#8217;twas a
surprise to see it fall earthward in obedience to some
law I could not in my daze define&ndash;&ndash;some law I had with
impatient labor, long, long ago, made sure I understood
and would remember. I looked away to sea, stared
into the sky, surveyed the hills: &#8217;twas the self-same world
I had known, constituted of the same materials, cohering
in the self-same way, obedient to the self-same laws,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
fashioned and adorned the same as it had been. &#8217;Twas
the self-same world of sea and sky and rock, wherein I
had so long dwelt&ndash;&ndash;a world familiar to my feet and eyes
and heart&#8217;s experience: a world of tree-clad, greening
hills, of known paths, of children&#8217;s shouting and the
chirp and song of spring-time. But there had come a
change upon its spirit: nay! thinks I, quite proud of
the conceit, its spirit had departed&ndash;&ndash;the thing had died
to me, and was become without meaning, an inimical
mystery. Then I felt the nerves of my soul tingle with
awakening: then I suffered very much.</p>
<p>And evening came....</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>By-and-by, having heartened myself with courageous
plans, I stepped out, with the feet of a man, upon the
Whisper Cove road. I had it in mind to enjoy with
Judith and John Cather the tender disclosure of their
love. I would kiss Judith, by Heaven! thinks I: I
would kiss her smile and blushes, whatever she thought
of the deed; and I would wring John Cather&#8217;s fragile
right hand until his teeth uncovered and he groaned for
mercy. &#8217;Twas fearsome weather, then, so that, overwrought
in the spirit as I was, I did not fail to feel the
oppression of it and the instinctive alarm it aroused.
&#8217;Twas very still and heavy and sullen and uneasy, &#8217;twas
pregnant of fears, like a moment of suspense: I started
when an alder branch or reaching spruce limb struck
me. In this bewildering weather there were no lovers
on the road; the valleys, the shadowy nooks, the
secluded reaches of path, lay vacant in the melancholy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
dusk. &#8217;Twas not until I came to the last hill, whence
the road tumbled down to a cluster of impoverished
cottages, listlessly clinging to the barren rock of Whisper
Cove, that I found Judith. John Cather was not about:
the maid was with Aunt Esther All, the gossip, and was
now so strangely agitated that I stopped in sheer amazement.
That the child should be abject and agonized
before the grim, cynical tattler of Whisper Cove! That
she should gesticulate in a way so passionate! That she
should fling her arms wide, that she should cover her
face with her hands, that she should in some grievous
disturbance beat upon her heart! I could not make
it out. &#8217;Twas a queer way, thinks I, to express the
rapture of her fortune; and no suspicion enlightened
me, because, I think, of the paralysis of despair upon
my faculties.</p>
<p>I approached.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go &#8217;way!&#8221; she cried.</p>
<p>I would not go away: &#8217;twas Aunt Esther, the gossip,
that went, and in a rout&ndash;&ndash;with a frightened backward
glance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go &#8217;way!&#8221; Judith pleaded. &#8220;I&#8217;m not able to bear
it, Dannie. Oh, go back!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas an unworthy whim, and I knew it to be so,
whatever the vagaries of maids may be, however natural
and to be indulged, at these crises of emotion. She had
sent John Cather away, it seemed, that she might be for
a space alone, in the way of maids at such times, as I
had been informed; and she would now deny to me the
reflection of her happiness.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span></div>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis unkind,&#8221; I chided, &#8220;not to share this thing
with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>She started: I recall that her eyes were round and
troubled with incomprehension.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve come to tell you, Judith,&#8221; says I, &#8220;that I do
not care.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas a brave lie: I am proud of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis kind,&#8221; she whispered.</p>
<p>We were alone. &#8217;Twas dusk: &#8217;twas dusk, to be sure,
of a disquieting day, with the sky most confidently foreboding
some new and surprising tactics in the ancient
warfare of the wind against us; but Judith and I, being
young and engaged with the passion of our years, had
no consciousness of the signs and wonders of the weather.
The weather concerns the old, the satisfied and disillusioned
of life, the folk from whom the romance of being
has departed. What care had we for the weather?
&#8217;Twas dusk, and we were alone at the turn of the road&ndash;&ndash;a
broad, rocky twist in the path, not without the softness
of grass, where lovers had kissed in parting since fishing
was begun from Twist Tickle and Whisper Cove. By
the falling shades and a screen of young leaves we were
hid from the prying eyes of Whisper Cove. &#8217;Twas from
me, then, that the maid withdrew into a deeper shadow,
as though, indeed, &#8217;twas not fit that we should be together.
I was hurt: but fancied, being stupid and self-centred,
that &#8217;twas a pang of isolation to which I must grow used.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Judy,&#8221; says I, &#8220;don&#8217;t, for pity&#8217;s sake, do that!
Why, maid,&#8221; I protested, &#8220;I don&#8217;t care. I&#8217;m glad&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m
just <i>glad</i>!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Glad!&#8221; she faltered, staring.</p>
<p>&#8220;To be sure I&#8217;m glad,&#8221; I cried.</p>
<p>She came close to me.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care,&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;You do not care!&#8221; she muttered, looking away.
&#8220;You do not care!&#8221; she repeated, in a voice that was
the faintest, most drear echo of my own.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not I!&#8221; I answered, stoutly. &#8220;Not a whit!&#8221;</p>
<p>She began to cry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look up!&#8221; I besought her. &#8220;I do not care,&#8221; I declared
again, seeking in this way to ease her pity of me.
&#8220;I do <i>not</i> care!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas a strange thing that happened then: first she
kissed the cuff of my coat, in the extravagant way of a
maid, and then all at once clapped her hands over her
eyes, as though to conceal some guilt from a righteous
person. I perceived this: I felt the shame she wished
to hide, and for a moment wondered what that shame
might be, but forgot, since the eyes were mine neither
to have read nor to admire, but John Cather&#8217;s. And
what righteousness had I? None at all that she should
stand ashamed before me. But there she stood, with
her blue eyes hid&ndash;&ndash;a maid in shame. I put my finger
under her chin and tried to raise her face, but could
not; nor could I with any gentleness withdraw her
hands. She was crying: I wondered why. I stooped
to peer between her fingers, but could see only tears
and the hot color of her flushes. I could not fathom
why she cried, except in excess of happiness or in adorable
pity of me. The wind rose, I recall, as I puzzled;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
&#8217;twas blowing through the gloaming in a soothing breeze
from the west, as though to put the fears of us to sleep.
A gentle gust, descending to our sheltered place,
rustled the leaves and played with the maid&#8217;s tawny
hair; and upon this she looked up&ndash;&ndash;and stepped into
the open path, where, while her tears dried and her
drooping helplessness vanished, she looked about the
sky, and felt of the wind, to discover its direction and
promise of strength. &#8217;Twas a thing of tragical significance,
as it seems to me now, looking back from the
quiet mood in which I dwell; but then, having concern
only to mitigate the maid&#8217;s hysteria, following upon the
stress of emotion I conceived she had undergone, this
anxious survey of the weather had no meaning. I
watched her: I lingered upon her beauty, softened,
perfected, enhanced in spiritual quality by the brush
of the dusk; and I could no longer wish John Cather
joy, but knew that I must persist in the knightly endeavor.</p>
<p>&#8220;The wind&#8217;s from the west,&#8221; says she. &#8220;A free wind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For Topmast Harbor,&#8221; says I; &#8220;but a mean breeze
for folk bound elsewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A free wind for Topmast Harbor,&#8221; she repeated.</p>
<p>&#8220;No matter,&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis a great thing,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;for them that are
bound to Topmast Harbor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas reproachfully spoken.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be going home now, maid,&#8221; I entreated.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll leave me walk with you, will you not?&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked down in a troubled muse.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll leave me follow, then,&#8221; says I, &#8220;to see that
you&#8217;ve no fear of the dark. &#8217;Twill be dark soon,
Judith, and I&#8217;m not wanting you to be afraid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come!&#8221; cries she. &#8220;I <i>will</i> walk with you&ndash;&ndash;home!&#8221;</p>
<p>She took my hand, and entwined her long fingers
with mine, in the intimate, confiding way she was used
to doing when we were a lad and a maid on the dark
roads. Many a time, when we were lad and maid, had
Judith walked forward, and I backward, to provide
against surprise by the shapes of night; and many a
dark time had she clutched my hand, nearing the lights
of Twist Tickle, to make sure that no harm would befall
her. And now, in this childish way, she held me; and
she walked with me twenty paces on the path to Twist
Tickle, whereupon she stopped, and led me back to that
same nook of the road, and doggedly released me, and
put an opposing hand on my breast.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you bide here,&#8221; says she; &#8220;and when I call, do
you go home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An you wish it,&#8221; I answered.</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas not more than twenty paces she walked towards
the impoverished cottages of Whisper Cove: then
turned, and came again to me. I wondered why she
stood in this agony of indecision: but could not tell,
nor can be blamed for the mystification, relentlessly as
I blame myself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dannie,&#8221; she moaned, looking up, &#8220;I can go nowhere!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You may go home, maid,&#8221; says I. &#8220;&#8217;Tis a queer
thing if you may not go home.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span></div>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis an unkind thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come!&#8221; I pleaded. &#8220;&#8217;Twill so very soon be dark
on the road; and I&#8217;m not wantin&#8217; you t&#8217; wander in the
dark.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot,&#8221; says she. &#8220;I just cannot!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Judith,&#8221; I chided, &#8220;you may. &#8217;Tis an unseemly
thing in you to say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I cannot bear it, Dannie!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would cry shame upon you, Judith,&#8221; I scolded,
&#8220;were <i>I</i> not so careful of your feelings.&#8221;</p>
<p>She seemed now to command herself with a resolution
of which tender maids like Judith should not be capable:
&#8217;tis too lusty and harsh a thing. I stood in awe of it.
&#8220;Dannie,&#8221; says she, &#8220;do you go home. I&#8217;ll follow an
I can. And if I do not come afore long, do you tell un
to think that I spend the night with the wife of Moses
Shoos. You may kiss me, Dannie, lad,&#8221; says she, &#8220;an
you cares t&#8217; do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>I did care: but dared not.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m wishin&#8217; for it,&#8221; says she.</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; I protested, &#8220;is you sure &#8217;tis right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis quite right,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;God understands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d be glad,&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;You may kiss me, then.&#8221;</p>
<p>I kissed her. &#8217;Tis a thing I regret: &#8217;twas a kiss so
lacking in earnest protraction&ndash;&ndash;so without warmth and
vigor. &#8217;Twas the merest brushing of her cheek. I
wish I had kissed her, like a man, in the fulness of
desire I felt; but I was bound, in the last light of that
day, to John Cather, in knightly honor.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span></div>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twas very nice,&#8221; says she. &#8220;I wisht you&#8217;d do it
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Dannie,&#8221; she whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Judith!&#8221; I cried. &#8220;Judith! For shame, to thank
me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; says she, &#8220;you&#8217;ll be off on the road.
You&#8217;ll make haste, will you not? And you&#8217;ll think,
will you not, that I spend the night with Mrs. Shoos?
You&#8217;ll not fret, Dannie: I&#8217;d grieve to think that you
fretted. I&#8217;d not have you, for all the world, trouble
about me. Not you,&#8221; she repeated, her voice falling.
&#8220;Not you, Dannie&ndash;&ndash;dear. You&#8217;ll be off, now,&#8221; she
urged, &#8220;for &#8217;tis long past time for tea. And you&#8217;ll tell
un all, will you not, that I talked o&#8217; spendin&#8217; the night
with Mrs. Moses Shoos at Whisper Cove?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An you wish it, Judith.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night!&#8221;</p>
<p>I pressed away....</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>When I came to our house on the neck of land by
the Lost Soul, I turned at the threshold to survey the
weather. I might have saved myself the pains and
puzzle of that regard. The print of sea and sky was
foreign: I could make nothing of it. &#8217;Twas a quiet
sea, breaking, in crooning lullaby, upon the rocks below
my bedroom window. It portended no disturbance: I
might sleep, thinks I, with the soft whispering to lull me,
being willing for the magic shoes of sleep to take me far
away from this agony as never man was before. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
wind was blowing from the west: but not in gusts&ndash;&ndash;a
sailing breeze for the timid. I was glad that there was
no venomous intention in the wind: &#8217;twas a mild and
dependable wind, grateful to such as fared easterly in
the night. I wished that all men might fare that way,
in the favoring breeze, but knew well enough that the
purposes of men are contrary, the one to the other,
making fair winds of foul, and foul of fair, so that there
was no telling, of any event, whatever the apparent
nature of it, whether sinister or benign, the preponderance
of woe or happiness issuing from it. Over all a
tender sky, spread with soft stretches of cloud, and set,
in its uttermost depths, with stars. &#8217;Twas dark enough
now for the stars to shine, making the most of the
moon&#8217;s absence, which soon would rise. Star upon
star: a multitude of serenely companionable lights, so
twinkling and knowing, so slyly sure of the ultimate
resolution of all the doubts and pains and perplexities
of the sons of men! But still there was abroad an oppression:
a forewarning, in untimely heat and strain,
of disastrous weather. &#8217;Twas that I felt when I turned
from the contemplation of the stars to go within,
that I might without improper delay inform our maid-servant
of Judith&#8217;s intention.</p>
<p>Then I joined my uncle....</p>

<h3>JOHN CATHER&#8217;S FATE</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8217;Twas with a start that I realized the lateness of
the hour. Time for liquor! &#8217;Twas hard to believe.
My uncle sat with his bottle and glass and little
brown jug. The glass was empty and innocent of
dregs; the stopper was still tight in the bottle, the jug
brimming with clear water from our spring. He had
himself fetched them from the pantry, it seemed, and
was now awaiting, with genial patience, the arrival of
company to give an air of conviviality to the evening&#8217;s
indulgence. I caught him in a smiling muse, his eye
on the tip of his wooden leg; he was sailed, it seemed,
to a clime of feeling far off from the stress out of which
I had come. There was no question: I was not interrogated
upon the lapse of the crew, as he called John
Cather and Judy and me, from the politeness of attendance
at dinner, which, indeed, he seemed to have forgotten
in a train of agreeable recollections. He was in
a humor as serene and cheerfully voluble as ever I met
with in my life; and when he had bade me join him at
the table to pour his first dram, he fell to on the narrative
of some adventure, humorously occurring, off the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
Funks, long, long ago, in the days of his boyhood. I
did not attend, nor did I pour the dram: being for the
time deeply occupied with reflections upon the square,
black bottle on the table before me&ndash;&ndash;the cure of moods
my uncle had ever maintained it would work.</p>
<p>I got up resolved.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where you goin&#8217;, Dannie?&#8221; says my uncle, his voice
all at once vacant of cheerfulness.</p>
<p>&#8220;To the pantry, sir,&#8221; I answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; says he. &#8220;Is it ginger-ale, Dannie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good,&#8221; says he, blankly; &#8220;that&#8217;s very good.
For Judy,&#8221; he added, &#8220;is fell into the habit o&#8217; tipplin&#8217;
by day, an&#8217; the ginger-ale is all runned out.&#8221;</p>
<p>I persevered on my way to the pantry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dannie!&#8221; he called.</p>
<p>I turned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is you quite sure, lad,&#8221; he asked, with an anxious
rubbing of his stubble of gray beard, &#8220;that &#8217;tisn&#8217;t
ginger-ale?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m wanting a glass, sir,&#8221; I replied, testily. &#8220;I see
but one on the table.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; he ejaculated. &#8220;A glass!&#8221;</p>
<p>I returned with the glass.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dannie,&#8221; says my uncle, feigning a relief he dared
not entertain, &#8220;you was wantin&#8217; a drop o&#8217; water, wasn&#8217;t
you?&#8221; He pushed the little brown jug towards me.
&#8220;I <i>&#8217;lowed</i> &#8217;twas water,&#8221; says he, hopefully, &#8220;when you
up an&#8217; spoke about gettin&#8217; a glass from the pantry.&#8221;
He urged the jug in my direction. &#8220;Ay,&#8221; he repeated,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
not hopefully now at all, but in a whisper more like
despair, &#8220;I jus&#8217; <i>&#8217;lowed</i> &#8217;twas a drop o&#8217; water.&#8221;</p>
<p>The jug remained in its place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dannie,&#8221; he entreated, with a thick forefinger still
urging the jug on its course, &#8220;you is thirsty, I <i>knows</i>
you is!&#8221;</p>
<p>I would not touch the jug.</p>
<p>&#8220;You been havin&#8217; any trouble, shipmate?&#8221; he gently
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; I groaned. &#8220;Trouble, God knows!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Along o&#8217; Judy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas along o&#8217; Judy.</p>
<p>&#8220;A drop o&#8217; water,&#8221; says he, setting the glass almost
within my hand, &#8220;will do you good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas so anxiously spoken that my courage failed
me. I splashed water into the glass and swallowed it.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good,&#8221; says he; &#8220;that&#8217;s very good.&#8221;</p>
<p>I pushed the glass away with contempt for its virtue
of comfort; and I laughed, I think, in a disagreeable
way, so that the old man, unused to manifestations as
harsh and irreligious as this, started in dismay.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; he echoed, staring, unconvinced and without
hope; &#8220;that&#8217;s very good.&#8221;</p>
<p>And now, a miserable determination returning, I
fixed my eyes again on the square, black bottle of rum.
&#8217;Twas a thing that fairly fascinated my attention. The
cure of despair was legendary, the palatable quality a
thing of mere surmise: I had never experienced either;
but in my childhood I had watched my uncle&#8217;s fearsome
moods vanish, as he downed his drams, one by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
one, giving way to a grateful geniality, which sent my
own bogies scurrying off, and I had fancied, from the
smack of his lips, and from the eager lifting of the
glasses at the Anchor and Chain, the St. John&#8217;s tap-room
we frequented, that a drop o&#8217; rum was a thing
to delight the dry tongue and gullet of every son of
man. My uncle sat under the lamp: I remember his
countenance, aside from the monstrous scars and disfigurements
which the sea had dealt him&ndash;&ndash;its anxious
regard of me, its intense concern, its gathering purpose,
the last of which I did not read at that moment, but
now recall and understand. &#8217;Twas quiet and orderly
in the room: the geometrical gentlemen were there
riding the geometrically tempestuous sea in a frame
beyond my uncle&#8217;s gargoylish head, and the tidied
rocking-chair, which I was used to addressing as a
belted knight o&#8217; the realm, austerely abode in a shadow.
I was in some saving way, as often happens in our lives,
conscious of these familiar things, to which we return
and cling in the accidents befalling us and in the
emergencies of feeling we must all survive. The room
was as our maid-servant had left it, bright and warm
and orderly: there was as yet no disarrangement by
the conviviality we were used to. &#8217;Tis not at all my
wish to trouble you with the despair I suffered that
night, with Judith gone from me: I would not utter
it&ndash;&ndash;&#8217;twas too deep and unusual and tragical to disturb
a world with. But still I stared at that square, black
bottle of rum, believing, as faith may be, in the surcease
it contained.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span></div>
<p>I watched that bottle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dannie,&#8221; says my uncle, with a wish, no doubt, for
a diversion, &#8220;is the moon up?&#8221;</p>
<p>I walked to the window. &#8220;&#8217;Tis up,&#8221; I reported;
&#8220;but &#8217;tis hid by clouds, an&#8217; the wind&#8217;s rising.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The wind rising?&#8221; says he. &#8220;&#8217;Twill do us no
harm.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, my uncle did not know which of us was
at sea.</p>
<p>&#8220;The wind,&#8221; he repeated, &#8220;will do no harm.&#8221;</p>
<p>I sat down again: and presently got my glass before
me, and reached for the square, black bottle of rum. I
could stand it no longer: I could really stand it no
longer&ndash;&ndash;the pain of this denial of my love was too
much for any man to bear.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have a drop,&#8221; says I, &#8220;for comfort.&#8221;</p>
<p>My uncle&#8217;s hand anticipated me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; says he. &#8220;For comfort, is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Unhappily, he had the bottle in his hand. &#8217;Twas
quite beyond my reach&ndash;&ndash;done with any courtesy. I
must wait for him to set it down again. The jug was
close enough, the glass, too; but the bottle was in
watchful custody. My uncle shook the bottle, and
held it to the lamp; he gauged its contents: &#8217;twas still
stout&ndash;&ndash;he sighed. And now he set it on the table,
with his great, three-fingered hand about the neck of
it, so that all hope of possession departed from me:
&#8217;twas a clutch too close and meaning to leave me room
for hope. I heard the wind, rising to a blow, but had
no fret on that account: there was none of us at sea,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
thank God! we were all ashore, with no care for what
the wind might do. I observed that my uncle was
wrought up to a pitch of concern to which he was not
used. He had gone pale, who was used, in exaltation
of feeling, to go crimson and blue in the scars of him;
but he had now gone quite white and coldly sweaty, in
a ghastly way, with the black bottle held up before him,
his wide little eyes upon it. I had never before known
him to be in fact afraid; but he was now afraid, and I
was persuaded of it, by his pallor, by his trembling
hand, by the white and stare of his eyes, by the drooping
lines of his poor, disfigured face. He turned from the
bottle to look at me; but I could not withstand the
poignancy of his regard: I looked away&ndash;&ndash;feeling some
shame, for which I could not account to myself. And
then he sighed, and clapped the black bottle on the
table, with a thump that startled me; and he looked
towards me with a resolution undaunted and determined.
I shall never forget, indeed, the expression he
wore: &#8217;twas one of perfect knightliness&ndash;&ndash;as high and
pure and courageous as men might wear, even in those
ancient times when honorable endeavor (by the tales of
John Cather) was a reward sufficient to itself.</p>
<p>I shall never forget: I could not forget.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dannie,&#8221; says he, listlessly, &#8220;&#8217;tis wonderful warm
in here. Cast up the window, lad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas not warm. There was no fire; and the
weather had changed, and the wind came in at the
open door, running in cold draughts about the house.
&#8217;Twas warm with the light of the lamp, to be sure;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
&#8217;twas cosey and grateful in the room: but the entering
swirl of wind was cold, and the emotional situation was
such in bleakness and mystery as to make me shiver.</p>
<p>I opened the window.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good,&#8221; he sighed. &#8220;How&#8217;s the tide?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis the ebb, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Could ye manage t&#8217; see Digger Rock?&#8221; he inquired.</p>
<p>The moon, breaking out, disclosed it: &#8217;twas a rock
near by, submerged save at low-tide&ndash;&ndash;I could see it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very good,&#8221; says he. &#8220;Could ye hit it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve nothing to shy, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But an you had?&#8221; he insisted.</p>
<p>My tutor entered the hall. I heard him go past the
door. &#8217;Twas in a quick, agitated step, not pausing to
regard us, but continuing up the stair to his own room.
I wondered why that was.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh, Dannie?&#8221; says my uncle.</p>
<p>&#8220;I might, sir,&#8221; I answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; says he, &#8220;try it with this bottle!&#8221;</p>
<p>I cast the bottle.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good,&#8221; says he. &#8220;Ye&#8217;re a wonderful shot,
Dannie. I heared un go t&#8217; smash. That&#8217;s good; that&#8217;s
<i>very</i> good!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>We sat, my uncle and I, for an hour after that, I
fancy, without managing an exchange: I would address
him, but he would not hear, being sunk most despondently
in his great chair by the empty, black grate, with
his eyes fixed in woe-begone musing upon the toes of
his ailing timber; and he would from time to time
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
insinuate an irrelevant word concerning the fishing,
and, with complaint, the bewildering rise and fall of
the price of fish, but the venture upon conversation was
too far removed from the feeling of the moment to
engage a reply. Presently, however, I commanded myself
sufficiently to observe him with an understanding
detached from my own bitterness; and I perceived
that he sat hopeless and in fear, as in the days when I
was seven, with his head fallen upon his breast and his
eyes grown tragical, afraid, but now in raw kind and
infinite measure, of the coming of night upon the world
he sailed by day. I heard nothing from my tutor&ndash;&ndash;no
creak of the floor, no step, no periodical creaking of his
rocking-chair. He had not, then, thinks I, cast off his
clothes; he had not gone to reading for holy orders, as
was, at intervals, his custom&ndash;&ndash;he had thrown himself on
his bed. But I neither cared nor wondered: I caught
sight of my uncle&#8217;s face again&ndash;&ndash;half amazed, wholly
despondent, but yet with a little glint of incredulous
delight playing, in brief flashes, upon it&ndash;&ndash;and I could
think of nothing else, not even of Judith, in her agony
of mysterious shame upon the Whisper Cove road,
nor of her disquieting absence from the house, nor of
the rising wind, nor of the drear world I must courageously
face when I should awake from that night&#8217;s
sleep.</p>
<p>I considered my uncle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do ye go t&#8217; bed, Dannie,&#8221; says he, looking up at
last. &#8220;Ye&#8217;ve trouble enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>I rose, but did not wish to leave him comfortless in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
the rising wind. I had rather sit with him, since he
needed me now, it seemed, more than ever before.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye&#8217;ll not trouble about me, lad?&#8221;</p>
<p>I would not be troubled.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good,&#8221; says he. &#8220;No need o&#8217; your troublin&#8217;
about <i>me</i>. Ol&#8217; Nick Top&#8217;s able t&#8217; take care o&#8217; <i>his</i>self!
That&#8217;s very good.&#8221;</p>
<p>I started away for bed, but turned at the door, as was
my custom, to wish my uncle good-night. I said nothing,
for he was in an indubitable way not to be disturbed&ndash;&ndash;having
forgotten me and the affection I sought
at all times to give him. He was fallen dejectedly in
his chair, repeating, &#8220;<i>For behold the Lord will come with
fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his
anger with fury, and his rebuke with the flames of fire.</i>&#8221;
I paused at the door to watch him, and I saw that his
maimed hand wandered over the table until it found
his glass, and that he caught and raised the glass, and
that he set it down again, and that he pushed the empty
thing away.</p>
<p>I saw all that....</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>And I went to bed; but I did not go to sleep. In the
first place, I could not, and, for better reason, my tutor
got astir the moment my door was closed. I heard his
cautious descent to the dining-room. The man had
been waiting to get me out of the way; but I heard him
go down, and that right easily, in the fall of his stockinged
feet, and in the click of his door-latch, and in the
creak of the stair. I cast my clothes off in haste, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
lay wide awake in my bed&ndash;&ndash;as who would not?&ndash;&ndash;listening
to the ominous murmur of voices from below. My
tutor, it seemed, was placid and determined; my uncle
was outraged. I heard the old man&#8217;s voice rise in a
rage, fall to a subdued complaint, patter along in beseeching.
It seemed &#8217;twas all to no purpose; my tutor
was obdurate, and my uncle yielded to his demands,
however unwillingly. There was the mutter of agreement,
there was the click of my uncle&#8217;s strong-box, there
was the clink of gold coin. I listened for the pop of a
new cork; but I did not hear it: I heard the jug
of spring water exchange hands&ndash;&ndash;no more than that.
&#8217;Twas very queer. But I was not concerned with it,
after all. Let my uncle and John Cather deal with each
other as they would, in any way engaging the clink of
gold from my uncle&#8217;s strong-box; &#8217;twas for me, unconcerned,
to look out of my window, to discover the
weather. And this I did; and I found the weather
threatening&ndash;&ndash;very dark, with the moon hid by clouds,
and blowing up in a way promising a strength of wind
not to be disregarded by folk who would put to sea.</p>
<p>The end of this was that John Cather and my uncle
came above. My tutor went straightway to his room,
with steps that hastened past my door; but my uncle
paused, pushed the door cautiously ajar, thrust in his
head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is you asleep, Dannie?&#8221; says he.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir. I&#8217;m wonderful wide awake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, well!&#8221; he whispered, in such a way that I perceived
his triumphant glee, though I could not see his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
face for the darkness of my room; &#8220;you might as well
turn over an&#8217; go t&#8217; sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; why, sir?&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Like a babe, Dannie,&#8221; says he, addressing me with
fondness, as though I were a little child again&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;jus&#8217;
like a babe.&#8221;</p>
<p>He walked to my window and looked out to sea.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dirty weather the morrow, sir,&#8221; I ventured.</p>
<p>&#8220;The lights o&#8217; the mail-boat!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;She&#8217;ve
left Fortune Harbor. Ecod, b&#8217;y!&#8221;</p>
<p>He withdrew at once and in haste, and I heard him
stump off to my tutor&#8217;s quarters, where, for a long time
after that, there occurred many and mysterious noises.
I could not understand, but presently made the puzzle
out: John Cather was packing up. &#8217;Twas beyond
doubt; the thump and creak, the reckless pulling of
drawers, steps taken in careless hurry and confusion,
the agitation of the pressing need of haste, all betrayed
the business in hand. John Cather was packing up:
he was rejected of Judith&ndash;&ndash;he was going away! It hurt
me sorely to think that the man would thus in impulsive
haste depart, after these years of intimate companionship,
with a regard so small for my wishes in the matter.
Go to sleep like a babe? I could not go to sleep at all;
I could but lie awake in trouble. John Cather was
packing up; he was going away! My uncle helped
him with his trunks down the stairs and to the stage-head,
where, no doubt, my uncle&#8217;s punt was waiting to
board the belated mail-boat&ndash;&ndash;the mean little trunk John
Cather had come with, and the great leather one I had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
bought him in London. I was glad, at any rate, that
my gifts&ndash;&ndash;the books and clothes and what-not I had
bought him abroad&ndash;&ndash;were not to be left to haunt me.
But that John Cather should not say good-bye! I could
not forgive him that. I waited and waited, lying awake
in the dark, for him to come. And come he did, when
the trunks were carried away and the whistle of the
mail-boat had awakened our harbor. He pushed my
door open without knocking, knowing well enough that
I was wide awake. &#8217;Twas then dark in my room; he
could not see me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are your matches?&#8221; says he.</p>
<p>I told him, but did not like the manner of his speech.
&#8217;Twas in a way to rouse the antagonism of any man,
being most harsh and hateful.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t find them,&#8221; he complained.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll find them well enough, John Cather,&#8221; I
chided, &#8220;an you looks with patience.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had no patience, it seemed, but continued to fumble
about, and at last, with his back turned to me,
got my lamp lighted. For a moment he stood staring
at the wall, as though he lacked the resolution to
turn. And when he wheeled I knew that I looked
upon the countenance of a man who had been broken
on the wheel; and I was very much afraid. John
Cather was splashed and streaked with the mud of the
hills. &#8217;Twas not this evidence of passionate wandering
that alarmed me; &#8217;twas his pallor and white lips, his
agonized brows, the gloomy depth to which his bloodshot
eyes had withdrawn.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; says he, &#8220;I want to look at you.&#8221;</p>
<p>I did not want to be looked at.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit up!&#8221; he commanded.</p>
<p>I sat up in bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Put the blanket down,&#8221; says he. &#8220;I have come, I
say, to look at you.&#8221;</p>
<p>I uncovered to my middle.</p>
<p>&#8220;And <i>this</i>,&#8221; says he, &#8220;is the body of you, is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>The lamp was moved close to my face. John Cather
laughed, and began, in a way I may not set down, to
comment upon me. &#8217;Twas not agreeable. I tried to
stop him. &#8217;Twas unkind to me and &#8217;twas most injurious
to himself. He did us vile injustice. I stopped
my ears against his raving, but could not shut it out.
&#8220;And this is the body of you! This is the body of you!&#8221;
Here was not the John Cather who had come to us
clear-eyed and buoyant and kindly out of the great
world; here was an evil John Cather&ndash;&ndash;the John Cather
of a new birth at Twist Tickle. &#8217;Twas the man our
land and hearts had made him; he had here among us
come to his tragedy and was cast away. I knew that the
change had been worked by love&ndash;&ndash;and I wondered that
love could accomplish the wreck of a soul. I tried to
stop his ghastly laughter, to quiet his delirium of brutality;
and presently he was still, but of exhaustion,
not of shame. Again he brought the lamp close to my
face, and read it, line upon line, until it seemed he
could bear no longer to peruse it. What he saw there I
do not know&ndash;&ndash;what to give him hope or still to increase
the depth of his hopelessness. He betrayed no feeling;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
but the memory of his pale despair continues with me
to this day, and will to the end of my years. Love has
never appeared to me in perfect beauty and gentleness
since that night; it can wear an ugly guise, achieve a
sinister purpose, I know.</p>
<p>John Cather set the lamp on the table, moving in a
preoccupation from which I had been cast out.</p>
<p>&#8220;John Cather!&#8221; I called.</p>
<p>My uncle shouted from below.</p>
<p>&#8220;John!&#8221; I urged.</p>
<p>&#8220;Parson,&#8221; my uncle roared, &#8220;ye&#8217;ll lose your passage!&#8221;</p>
<p>Cather blew out the light.</p>
<p>&#8220;John,&#8221; I pleaded, &#8220;you&#8217;ll not go without saying
good-bye?&#8221;</p>
<p>He stopped on the threshold; but I did not hear him
turn. I called him again; he wheeled, came stumbling
quickly to my bed, caught my hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Forgive me, Dannie!&#8221; he groaned. &#8220;My heart is
broken!&#8221;</p>
<p>He ran away: I never saw him again....</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>And now, indeed, was the world gone all awry!
What had in the morning of that day been a prospect
of joy was vanished in a drear mist of broken hopes.
Here was John Cather departed in sore agony, for
which was no cure that ever I heard of or could conceive.
Here was John Cather gone with the wreck of
a soul. A cynical, purposeless, brooding life he must
live to his last day: there was no healing in all the
world for his despair. Here with us&ndash;&ndash;to whom, in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
years of our intercourse, he gave nothing but gladness&ndash;&ndash;his
ruin had been wrought. &#8217;Twas not by wish of us;
but there was small comfort in the reflection, since John
Cather must suffer the same. Here was John Cather
gone; and here, presently, was my uncle, pacing the
floor below. Up and down, up and down: I thought
the pat of his wooden leg would go on forever&ndash;&ndash;would
forever, by night and day, express the restlessness of
thirst. And here was Judy, abroad, in trouble I could
not now divine&ndash;&ndash;&#8217;twas a thing most strange and disturbing
that she should stand in distress before me. I
had accounted for it, but could not now explain&ndash;&ndash;not
with John Cather gone. I was mystified, not agitated
by alarms. I would meet the maid on the Whisper Cove
road in the morning, thinks I, and resolve the puzzle.
I would discover more than that. I would discover
whether or not I had blundered. But this new hope,
springing confidently though it did, could not thrive in
the wretchedness of John Cather&#8217;s departure. I was
not happy.</p>
<p>My uncle roughly awoke me at dawn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir?&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Judy,&#8221; says he, &#8220;haves disappeared.&#8221;</p>
<p>He held me until he perceived that I had commanded
myself....</p>

<h2>XXV</h2>
<h3>TO SEA</h3>
</div>
<p>Judith had vanished! Our maid-servant, astir in
the child&#8217;s behalf before dawn, in her anxious way,
was returned breathless from Whisper Cove with the
report. There was no Judith with the wife of Moses
Shoos: nor had there been that night. &#8217;Twas still but
gray abroad&ndash;&ndash;a drear dawn: promising a belated, sullen
day. We awoke the harbor to search the hills, the
ledges of the cliffs, the surf-washed shore. &#8217;Twas my
uncle hither, the maid-servant thither, myself beyond.
Clamorous knocking, sudden lights in the cottages,
lights pale in the murky daylight, and a subdued gathering
of our kind men-folk: I remember it all&ndash;&ndash;the winged
haste, the fright of them that were aroused, the shadows
and the stumbling of the farther roads, the sickly, sleepy
lights in the windows, the troubled dawn. We dispersed:
day broadened, broke gray and glum upon Twin Islands&ndash;&ndash;but
discovered no lost maid to us.</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas whispered about, soon, that the women had
spoken evil of Judith in our harbor; and pursuing this
ill-omened rumor, in a rage I could not command, I
came at last upon the shameful truth: the women had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
spoken scandal of the maid, the which she had learned
from Aunt Esther All, the Whisper Cove gossip. The
misfortune of gentle Parson Stump, poor man! who had
in the ear of Eli Flack&#8217;s wife uttered a sweetly jocular
word concerning Judith and the honorable intention of
John Cather, who walked with her alone on the roads,
about his love-making. But, unhappily, the parson
being absent-minded, &#8217;twas into the dame&#8217;s deaf ear
he spoke, and his humor became, in transmission, by
pure misfortune, an evil charge.</p>
<p>There was then no help for it, old wives being
what they are: authorized by the gentle parson, depending
upon the report of a dame of character, the
tittle-tattle spread and settled like a mist, defiling
Judith to the remotest coves of Twin Islands. And
Judith was vanished! I knew then, in the gray noon
of that day, why the child had cried in that leafy nook
of the Whisper Cove road that she could go nowhere.</p>
<p>I cursed myself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop, Dannie!&#8221; cries my uncle. &#8220;She&#8217;s still on the
hills&ndash;&ndash;somewheres there, waitin&#8217; t&#8217; be sought out an&#8217;
comforted an&#8217; fetched home.&#8221;</p>
<p>I thought otherwise.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ve lied down there,&#8221; says he, &#8220;t&#8217; cry an&#8217; wait
for me an&#8217; you.&#8221;</p>
<p>I watched him pace the garden-path.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; I&#8217;m not able, the day, for sheer want o&#8217; rum,&#8221;
he muttered, &#8220;t&#8217; walk the hills.&#8221;</p>
<p>I looked away to the sombre hills, where she might
lie waiting for him and me; but my glance ran far beyond,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
to the low, gray sky and to a patch of darkening
sea. And I cursed myself again&ndash;&ndash;my stupidity and
ease of passion and the mean conceit of myself by
which I had been misled to the falsely meek conclusion
of yesterday&ndash;&ndash;I cursed myself, indeed, with a live wish
for punishment, in that I had not succored the maid
when she had so frankly plead for my strength. John
Cather? what right had I to think that she had loved
him? On the hills? nay, she was not there; she was
not on the hills, waiting for my uncle and me&ndash;&ndash;she was
gone elsewhere, conserving her independence and self-respect,
in the womanly way she had. My uncle
fancied she was a clinging child: I knew her for a
proud and impulsively wilful woman. With this gossip
abroad to flout her, she would never wait on the hills for
my uncle and me: &#8217;twas the ultimate pain she could not
bear in the presence of such as loved and trusted her;
&#8217;twas the event she had feared, remembering her mother,
all her life long, dwelling in sensitive dread, as I knew.
She would flee the shame of this accusation, without
fear or lingering, unable to call upon the faith of us.
&#8217;Twas gathering in my mind that she had fled north,
as the maids of our land would do, in the spring, with
the Labrador fleet bound down for the fishing. &#8217;Twas
a reasonable purpose to possess her aimless feet. She
would ship on a Labradorman: she might, for the
wishing&ndash;&ndash;she would go cook on a north-bound craft
from Topmast Harbor, as many a maid of our coast
was doing. And by Heaven! thinks I, she had.</p>
<p>Her mother&#8217;s punt was gone from Whisper Cove.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span></div>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ve lied down there on the hills,&#8221; my uncle protested,
&#8220;t&#8217; cry an&#8217; wait. Ye&#8217;re not searchin&#8217;, Dannie,
as ye ought. She&#8217;ve <i>jus&#8217;</i> lied down, I tell ye,&#8221; he
whimpered, &#8220;t&#8217; wait.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas not so, I thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ve her mother&#8217;s shame come upon her,&#8221; says
he, &#8220;an&#8217; she&#8217;ve hid.&#8221;</p>
<p>I wished it might be so.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jus&#8217; lied down an&#8217; hid,&#8221; he repeated.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; says I. &#8220;She&#8217;d never weakly hide her
head from this.&#8221;</p>
<p>He eyed me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not Judith!&#8221; I expostulated.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;d never bear her mother&#8217;s shame, Dannie,&#8221; says
he. &#8220;She&#8217;d run away an&#8217; hide. She&ndash;&ndash;she&ndash;&ndash;<i>told</i> me so.&#8221;</p>
<p>I observed my uncle: he was gone with the need of
rum&ndash;&ndash;exhausted and unnerved: his face all pallid and
splotched. &#8217;Twas a ghastly thing to watch him stump
the gravelled walk of our garden in the gray light of that
day.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Nicholas, sir,&#8221; says I, for the moment forgetting
the woe of Judith&#8217;s hapless state in this new
alarm, &#8220;do you come within an&#8217; have a dram.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye&#8217;re not knowin&#8217; <i>how</i> t&#8217; search,&#8221; he complained.
&#8220;Ye&#8217;re but a pack o&#8217; dunderheads!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, sir!&#8221; I pleaded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is ye been t&#8217; Skeleton Droch?&#8221; he demanded.
&#8220;She&#8217;ve a habit o&#8217; readin&#8217; there. No!&#8221; he growled,
in a temper; &#8220;you isn&#8217;t had the <i>sense</i> t&#8217; go t&#8217; Skeleton
Droch.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span></div>
<p>&#8220;A dram, sir,&#8221; I ventured, &#8220;t&#8217; comfort you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; ye bide here, ye dunderhead!&#8221; he accused.</p>
<p>I put my hand on his shoulder: he flung it off. I
took his arm: he wrenched himself free in an indignant
passion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye&#8217;re needin&#8217; it, sir,&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;For God&#8217;s sake, child!&#8221; he cried; &#8220;do you go find
the maid an&#8217; leave me be. God knows I&#8217;ve trouble
enough without ye!&#8221;</p>
<p>The maid was not at Skeleton Droch: neither on the
hills, nor in the hiding-places of the valleys, nor lying
broken on the ledges of the cliffs, nor swinging in the
sea beneath&ndash;&ndash;nor was she anywhere on the land of Twin
Islands or in the waters that restlessly washed the boundary
of gray rock. &#8217;Twas near evening now, and a
dreary, angrily windy time. Our men gathered from
shore and inland barren&ndash;&ndash;and there was no Judith, nor
cold, wet body of Judith, anywhere to be found. &#8217;Twas
unthinkingly whispered, then, that the maid had fled
with John Cather on the mail-boat: this on Tom Tulk&#8217;s
Head, in its beginning, and swiftly passed from tongue
to tongue. Being overwrought when I caught the
surmise&ndash;&ndash;&#8217;twas lusty young Jack Bluff that uttered
it before me&ndash;&ndash;I persuaded the youth of his error,
which, upon rising, he admitted, as did they all of that
group, upon my request, forgiving me, too, I think, the
cruel abruptness of my argument, being men of feeling,
every one. The maid was not gone with John Cather,
she was not on the hills of Twin Islands; she was then
fled to Topmast Harbor for self-support, that larger
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
settlement, whence many Labradormen put out at this
season for the northerly fishing. And while, sheltered
from the rising wind, the kind men-folk of our harbor
talked with my uncle and me on Eli Flack&#8217;s stage, there
came into the tickle from Topmast Harbor, in quest of
water, a punt and a man, being bound, I think, for
Jimmie Tick&#8217;s Cove. &#8217;Twas by him reported that a
maid of gentle breeding had come alone in a punt to
Topmast in the night. And her hair? says I. She had
hair, and a wonderful sight of it, says he. And big, blue
eyes? says I. She <i>had</i> eyes, says he; an&#8217; she had a
nose, so far as he could tell, which had clapped eyes on
the maid, an&#8217; she had teeth an&#8217; feet, himself being able
to vouch for the feet, which clipped it over the Topmast
roads quite lively, soon after dawn, in search of a
schooner bound down the Labrador.</p>
<p>I knew then into what service the <i>Shining Light</i>
should be commissioned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, lad,&#8221; says my uncle.</p>
<p>&#8220;And will you ship, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Lord love us, shipmate!&#8221; he roared, indignantly,
to the amazement of our folk; &#8220;is ye thinkin&#8217;
I&#8217;m past my labor?&#8221;</p>
<p>I nodded towards Whisper Cove.</p>
<p>&#8220;The man,&#8221; he agreed.</p>
<p>It came about thus that I sought out Moses Shoos,
wishing for him upon this high adventure because of
his chivalry. Nay, but in Twist Tickle, whatever the
strength and courage and kindliness of our folk, there
was no man so to be desired in a crucial emergency.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
The fool of the place was beyond purchase, beyond
beseeching: kept apart by his folly from every unworthy
motive to action. He was a man of pure leading,
following a voice, a vision: I would have him upon
this sacred adventure in search of the maid I loved.
&#8217;Twas no mean errand, no service to be paid for; &#8217;twas
a high calling&ndash;&ndash;a ringing summons, it seemed to me,
to perilous undertakings, rewarded by opportunity for
peril in service of a fond, righteous cause. Nay, but
I would have this unspoiled fool: I would have for
companion the man who put his faith in visions, could
I but win him. I believed in visions&ndash;&ndash;in the deep,
limpid, mysterious springs of conduct. I believed in
visions&ndash;&ndash;in the unreasoning progress, an advance in the
way of life not calculated, but made in unselfish faith,
with eyes lifted up from the vulgar, swarming, assailing
advantages of existence. My uncle and the fool and I!
there was no peril upon the sea to daunt us: we would
find and fetch, to her own place, in perfect honor,
the maid I loved. And of all this I thought, whatever
the worth of it, as I ran upon the Whisper
Cove road, in the evening of that gray, blustering
day.</p>
<p>Moses was within.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here you is,&#8221; he drawled. &#8220;I &#8217;lowed you&#8217;d come.
How&#8217;s the weather?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twill blow big guns, Moses,&#8221; I answered; &#8220;and
I&#8217;ll not deceive you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well!&#8221; he sighed.</p>
<p>And would he go with us?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I been waitin&#8217; for you, Dannie,&#8221; says he. &#8220;I been
sittin&#8217; here in the kitchen&ndash;&ndash;waitin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas a hopeful word.</p>
<p>&#8220;If mother was here,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;she&#8217;d have
&#8217;lowed I&#8217;d better wait. &#8216;You wait for Dannie,&#8217; mother
would have &#8217;lowed, &#8216;until he comes.&#8217; An&#8217; so I <i>been</i>
waitin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, there I was.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was on&#8217;y mother,&#8221; he added; &#8220;an&#8217;, o&#8217; course,
I&#8217;m married now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Walrus Liz of the Labrador came in. I rose&ndash;&ndash;and
was pleasantly greeted. She sat, then, and effaced herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Moses Shoos,&#8221; says Moses, with a fond look
upon that woman of ill-favor and infinite tenderness,
&#8220;haves jus&#8217; <i>got</i> t&#8217; be consulted.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was grown hopeless&ndash;&ndash;remembering Tumm&#8217;s story
of the babies.</p>
<p>&#8220;In a case like this,&#8221; Moses confided, &#8220;mother always
&#8217;lowed a man <i>ought</i> to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But your wife?&#8221; I demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my goodness, Dannie!&#8221; cries he. &#8220;For shame!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me quickly, Moses.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Moses Shoos,&#8221; he answered, with gravest
dignity, &#8220;<i>always</i> &#8217;lows, agreein&#8217; with me&ndash;&ndash;that <i>mother</i>
knowed!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas in this way that Moses Shoos shipped on the
<i>Shining Light</i>....</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Shortly now, by an arrangement long made and persistently
continued, we had the <i>Shining Light</i> ready for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
sea&ndash;&ndash;provisioned, her water-casks full. I ran through
the house upon a last survey; and I found my uncle at
the pantry door, his bag on his back, peering into the
dark interior of the little room, in a way most melancholy
and desirous, upon the long row of bottles of rum.
He sighed, closed the door with scowling impatience,
and stumped off to board the ship: I was not heroic,
but subtracted one from that long row, and stowed it
away in a bag I carried. We dropped the anchor of
the <i>Shining Light</i>, and beat out, through the tickle,
to the wide, menacing sea, with the night coming down
and a gale of wind blowing lustily up from the gray
northeast. &#8217;Twas thus not in flight the <i>Shining Light</i>
continued her cruise, &#8217;twas in pursuit of the maid I
loved: a thing infinitely more anxious and momentous&ndash;&ndash;a
thing that meant more than life or death to me, with
the maid gone as cook on a Labrador craft. &#8217;Twas
sunset time; but there was no sunset&ndash;&ndash;no fire in the
western sky: no glow or effulgent glory or lurid threat.
The whole world was gone a dreary gray, with the
blackness of night descending: a darkening zenith, a
gray horizon lined with cold, black cloud, a coast without
tender mercy for the ships of men, a black sea
roughening in a rage to the northeast blasts. &#8217;Twas all
hopeless and pitiless: an unfeeling sea, but troubled,
it seemed to me, by depths of woe and purpose and
difficulty we cannot understand. We were bound for
Topmast Harbor, on a wind favorable enough for courageous
hearts; and my uncle had the wheel, and the
fool of Twist Tickle and I kept the deck to serve him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
He did not call upon us to shorten sail, in answer to the
old schooner&#8217;s complaint; and I was glad that he did
not, as was the fool also....</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&#8217;Twas night when we put into Topmast Harbor; but
my uncle and the fool and I awoke the place without
regard for its way-harbor importance or number of
houses. There was no maid there, said they; there
had been a maid, come at dawn, but she was fortunately
shipped, as she wished to be. What maid was
that? They did not know. Was she a slender, tawny-haired,
blue-eyed, most beauteous maid? They did
but sleepily stare. I found a man, awakened from
sound slumber, who remembered: ay, there was a
maid of that description, who had shipped for cook
on the <i>Likely Lass</i>. And whence the <i>Likely Lass</i>?
Bonavist&#8217; Bay, says he, put in for rest: a seventy-tonner,
put out on the favoring wind. And was there
another woman aboard? Ecod! he did not know:
&#8217;twas a craft likely enough for any maid, other
woman aboard or not. And so we set out again, in
the night, dodging the rocks of that tickle, by my uncle&#8217;s
recollection, and presently found ourselves bound
north, in search of the <i>Likely Lass</i>, towards a sea
that was bitter with cold and dark and wind, aboard
a schooner that was far past the labor of dealing with
gusts and great waves.</p>
<p>And in the night it came on to blow very hard from
the east, with a freezing sleet, which yet grew colder,
until snow mixed with it, and at last came in stifling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
clouds. It blew harder: we drove on, submerged in
racing froth to the hatches, sheathed in ice, riding
on a beam, but my uncle, at the wheel, standing
a-drip, in cloth of ice, as long ago he had stood,
in the first of the cruise of the <i>Shining Light</i>, would
have no sail off the craft, but humored her northward
in chase of the <i>Likely Lass</i>. &#8217;Twas a reeling,
plunging, smothered progress through the breaking sea,
in a ghostly mist of snow swirling in the timid yellow of
our lights, shrouding us as if for death in the rush and
seethe of that place. There was a rain of freezing spray
upon us&ndash;&ndash;a whipping rain of spray: it broke from the
bows and swept past, stinging as it went. &#8217;Twas as
though the very night&ndash;&ndash;the passion of it&ndash;&ndash;congealed
upon us. There was no reducing sail&ndash;&ndash;not now, in this
cold rage of weather. We were frozen stiff and white:
&#8217;twas on the course, with a clever, indulgent hand to lift
us through, or &#8217;twas founder in the crested waves that
reached for us.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dannie!&#8221; my uncle shouted.</p>
<p>I sprang aft: but in the roar of wind and swish and
thud of sea could not hear him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Put your ear close,&#8221; he roared.</p>
<p>I heard that; and I put my anxious ear close.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m gettin&#8217; kind o&#8217; cold,&#8221; says he. &#8220;Is ye got a fire
in the cabin?&#8221;</p>
<p>I had not.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get one,&#8221; says he.</p>
<p>I got a fire alight in the cabin. &#8217;Twas a red, roaring
fire. I called my uncle from the cabin door. The old
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span>
man gave the wheel to the fool and came below in a
humor the most genial: he was grinning, indeed, under
the crust of ice upon his beard; and he was rubbing his
stiff hands in delight. He was fair happy to be abroad
in the wind and sea with the <i>Shining Light</i> underfoot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye got it warm in here,&#8221; says he.</p>
<p>&#8220;I got more than that, sir,&#8221; says I. &#8220;I got a thing
to please you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whereupon I fetched the bottle of rum from my bag.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rum!&#8221; cries he. &#8220;Well, well!&#8221;</p>
<p>I opened the bottle of rum.</p>
<p>&#8220;Afore ye pours,&#8221; he began, &#8220;I &#8217;low I&#8217;d best&ndash;&ndash;God&#8217;s
sake! What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas a great sea breaking over us.</p>
<p>&#8220;Moses!&#8221; my uncle hailed.</p>
<p>The schooner was on her course: the fool had clung
to the wheel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ice in that sea, Dannie,&#8221; says my uncle. &#8220;An&#8217; ye
got a bottle o&#8217; rum! Well, well! Wonderful sight o&#8217;
ice t&#8217; the nor&#8217;ard. Ye&#8217;ll find, I bet ye, that the fishin&#8217;
fleet is cotched fast somewheres long about the straits.
An&#8217; a bottle o&#8217; rum for a cold night! Well, well! I
bet ye, Dannie,&#8221; says he, &#8220;that the <i>Likely Lass</i> is
gripped by this time. An&#8217; ye got a bottle o&#8217; rum!&#8221;
cries he, in a beaming fidget. &#8220;Rum&#8217;s a wonderful
thing on a cold night, lad. Nothin&#8217; like it. I&#8217;ve tried
it. Was a time,&#8221; he confided, &#8220;when I was sort o&#8217;
give t&#8217; usin&#8217; of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>I made to pour him a dram.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Leave me hold that there bottle,&#8221; says he. &#8220;I
wants t&#8217; smell of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas an eager sniff.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>&#8217;Tis</i> rum,&#8221; says he, simply.</p>
<p>I raised the bottle above the glass.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come t&#8217; think of it, Dannie,&#8221; says he, with a wistful
little smile, &#8220;that there bottle o&#8217; rum will do more good
where you had it than where I&#8217;d put it.&#8221;</p>
<p>I corked the bottle and returned it to my bag.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good,&#8221; he sighed; &#8220;that&#8217;s very good!&#8221;</p>
<p>I made him a cup o&#8217; tea....</p>
<p>When I got the wheel, with Moses Shoos forward
and my uncle gone asleep below, &#8217;twas near dawn. We
were under reasonable sail, running blindly through the
night: there were no heroics of carrying-on&ndash;&ndash;my uncle
was not the man to bear them. But we were frozen
stiff&ndash;&ndash;every block and rope of us. And &#8217;twas then blowing
up with angrier intention; and &#8217;twas dark and very
cold, I recall&ndash;&ndash;and the air was thick with the dust of
snow, so that &#8217;twas hard to breathe. Congealing drops
of spray came like bullets: I recall that they hurt me.
I recall, too, that I was presently frozen to the deck, and
that my mitts were stuck to the wheel&ndash;&ndash;that I became
fixed and heavy. The old craft had lost her buoyant
will: she labored through the shadowy, ghostly crested
seas, in a fashion the most weary and hopeless. I
fancied I knew why: I fancied, indeed, that she had
come close to her last harbor. And of this I soon made
sure: I felt of her, just before the break of day, discovering,
but with no selfish perturbation, that she was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
exhausted. I felt of her tired plunges, of the stagger
of her, of her failing strength and will; and I perceived&ndash;&ndash;by
way of the wheel in my understanding hands&ndash;&ndash;that
she would be glad to abandon this unequal struggle
of the eternal youth of the sea against her age and
mortality. And the day broke; and with the gray light
came the fool of Twist Tickle over the deck. &#8217;Twas a
sinister dawn: no land in sight&ndash;&ndash;but a waste of raging
sea to view&ndash;&ndash;and the ship laden forward with a shameful
burden of ice.</p>
<p>Moses spoke: I did not hear him in the wind, because,
I fancy, of the ice in my ear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t hear ye!&#8221; I shouted.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ve begun t&#8217; leak!&#8221; he screamed.</p>
<p>I knew that she had.</p>
<p>&#8220;No use callin&#8217; the skipper,&#8221; says he. &#8220;All froze up.
Leave un sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Goin&#8217; down,&#8221; says he. &#8220;Knowed she would.&#8221;</p>
<p>My uncle came on deck: he was smiling&ndash;&ndash;most placid,
indeed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;Day, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Leakin&#8217;,&#8221; says Moses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Goin&#8217; down,&#8221; Moses screamed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Knowed she would,&#8221; my uncle roared. &#8220;Can&#8217;t last
long in this. What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas floe ice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Still water,&#8221; says he. &#8220;Leave me have that there
wheel, Dannie. Go t&#8217; sleep!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span></div>
<p>I would stand by him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go t&#8217; sleep!&#8221; he commanded. &#8220;I&#8217;ll wake ye afore
she goes.&#8221;</p>
<p>I went to sleep: but the fool, I recall, beat me at it;
he was in a moment snoring....</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>When I awoke &#8217;twas broad day&ndash;&ndash;&#8217;twas, indeed, late
morning. The <i>Shining Light</i> was still. My uncle and
the fool sat softly chatting over the cabin table, with
breakfast and steaming tea between. I heard the roar
of the wind, observed beyond the framing door the
world aswirl and white; but I felt no laboring heave,
caught no thud and swish of water. The gale, at any
rate, had not abated: &#8217;twas blowing higher and colder.
My uncle gently laughed, when I was not yet all awake,
and the fool laughed, too; and they ate their pork and
brewis and sipped their tea with relish, as if abiding in
security and ease. I would fall asleep again: but got
the smell of breakfast in my nose, and must get up; and
having gone on deck I found in the narrow, white-walled
circle of the storm a little world of ice and writhing
space. The <i>Shining Light</i> was gripped: her foremast
was snapped, her sails hanging stiff and frozen; she
was listed, bedraggled, incrusted with ice&ndash;&ndash;drifted high
with snow. &#8217;Twas the end of the craft: I knew it.
And I went below to my uncle and the fool, sad at heart
because of this death, but wishing very much, indeed,
for my breakfast. &#8217;Twas very warm and peaceful in
the cabin, with pork and brewis on the table, my uncle
chuckling, the fire most cheerfully thriving. I could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span>
hear the wind&ndash;&ndash;the rage of it&ndash;&ndash;but felt no stress of
weather.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stove in, Dannie,&#8221; says my uncle. &#8220;She&#8217;ll sink
when the ice goes abroad.&#8221;</p>
<p>I asked for my fork.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fill up,&#8221; my uncle cautioned. &#8220;Ye&#8217;ll need it afore
we&#8217;re through.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas to this I made haste.</p>
<p>&#8220;More pork than brewis, lad,&#8221; he advised. &#8220;Pork
takes more grindin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>I attacked the pork.</p>
<p>&#8220;I got your bag ready,&#8221; says he.</p>
<p>Then I had no cause to trouble....</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&#8217;Twas deep night, the gale still blowing high with
snow, when the wind changed. It ran to the north&ndash;&ndash;shifted
swiftly to the west. The ice-pack stirred: we
felt the schooner shiver, heard the tumult of warning
noises, as that gigantic, lethargic mass was aroused to
unwilling motion by the lash of the west wind. The
hull of the <i>Shining Light</i> collapsed. &#8217;Twas time to be
off. I awoke the fool&ndash;&ndash;who had still soundly slept.
The fool would douse the cabin fire, in a seemly way,
and put out the lights; but my uncle forbade him,
having rather, said he, watch the old craft go down
with a warm glow issuing from her. Presently she was
gone, all the warmth and comfort and hope of the world
expiring in her descent: there was no more a <i>Shining
Light</i>; and we three folk were cast away on a broad
pan of ice, in the midst of night and driving snow. Of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span>
the wood they had torn from the schooner against this
time, the fool builded a fire, beside which we cowered
from the wind; and soon, the snow failing and the night
falling clear and starlit, points of flickering light appeared
on the ice beyond us. There were three, I recall,
diminishing in the distance; and I knew, then,
what I should do in search of Judith when the day
came. Three schooners cast away beyond us; one
might be the <i>Likely Lass</i>: I would search for Judith,
thinks I, when day came. &#8217;Twas very long in coming,
and &#8217;twas most bitter cold and discouraging in
its arrival: a thin, gray light, with no hopeful hue
of dawn in the east&ndash;&ndash;frosty, gray light, spreading reluctantly
over the white field of the world to a black
horizon. I wished, I recall, while I waited for broader
day, that some warm color might appear to hearten us,
some tint, however pale and transient, to recall the
kindlier mood of earth to us; and there came, in answer
to my wishing, a flush of rose in the east, which waxed
and endured, spreading its message, but failed, like a
lamp extinguished, leaving the world all sombre and
inimical, as it had been.</p>
<p>I must now be off alone upon my search: my wooden-legged
uncle could not travel the ice&ndash;&ndash;nor must the fool
abandon him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I &#8217;lowed ye would, lad,&#8221; says he, &#8220;like any other
gentleman.&#8221;</p>
<p>I bade them both good-bye.</p>
<p>&#8220;Three schooners cast away t&#8217; the nor&#8217;ard,&#8221; says
he. &#8220;I&#8217;m hopin&#8217; ye&#8217;ll find the <i>Likely Lass</i>. Good-bye,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span>
Dannie. I &#8217;low I&#8217;ve fetched ye up very well. Good-bye,
Dannie.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was moved away now: but halted, like a dog between
two masters.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-bye!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;God bless ye, Dannie&ndash;&ndash;God
bless ye!&#8221;</p>
<p>I turned away.</p>
<p>&#8220;God bless ye!&#8221; came faintly after me.</p>
<p>That night I found Judith with the crew of the <i>Likely
Lass</i>, sound asleep, her head lying, dear child! on the
comfortable breast of the skipper&#8217;s wife. And she was
very glad, she said, that I had come....</p>

<h3>THE DEVIL&#8217;S TEETH</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8217;Twill not, by any one, be hard to recall that the
great gale of that year, blowing unseasonably with
snow, exhausted itself in three days, leaving the early
birds of the Labrador fleet, whose northward flitting
had been untimely, wrecked and dispersed upon the
sea. In the reaction of still, blue weather we were
picked up by the steamer <i>Fortune</i>, a sealing-craft commissioned
by the government for rescue when surmise of
the disaster grew large; but we got no word of my uncle
and the fool of Twist Tickle until the fore-and-after
<i>Every Time</i> put into St. John&#8217;s with her flag flying half-mast
in the warm sunshine. &#8217;Twas said that she had
the bodies of men aboard: and &#8217;twas a grewsome truth&ndash;&ndash;and
the corpses of women, too, and of children. She
brought more than the dead to port: she brought the
fool, and the living flesh and spirit of my uncle&ndash;&ndash;the old
man&#8217;s body ill-served by the cold, indeed, but his soul,
at sight of me, springing into a blaze as warm and strong
and cheerful as ever I had known. &#8217;Twas all he needed,
says he, t&#8217; work a cure: the sight of a damned little
grinnin&#8217; Chesterfieldian young gentleman! Whatever
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span>
the actual effect of this genteel spectacle, my uncle was
presently on his feet again, though continuing much
broken in vigor; and when he was got somewhat
stronger we set out for Twist Tickle, to which we came,
three days later, returning in honor to our own place.</p>
<p>The folk were glad that we were all come back to
them....</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>I loved Judith: I loved the maid with what exalted
wish soul and body of me understood&ndash;&ndash;conceiving her
perfect in every grace and spiritual adornment: a maid
lifted like a star above the hearts of the world. I considered
my life, and counted it unworthy, as all lives
must be before her: I considered my love, but found no
spot upon it. I loved the maid: and was now grown
to be a man, able, in years and strength and skill of
mind and hand, to cherish her; and I would speak to
her of this passion and dear hope, but must not, because
of the mystery concerning me. There came, then, an
evening when I sought my uncle out to question him;
&#8217;twas a hushed and compassionate hour, I recall, the
sunset waxing glorious above the remotest sea, and the
night creeping with gentle feet upon the world, to spread
its soft blanket of shadows.</p>
<p>I remembered the gray stranger&#8217;s warning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here I is, lad,&#8221; cries my uncle, with an effort at
heartiness, which, indeed, had departed from him, and
would not come again. &#8220;Here I is&ndash;&ndash;havin&#8217; a little dram
o&#8217; rum with Nature!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas a draught of salt air he meant.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Dannie,&#8221; says he, in overwhelming uneasiness, his
voice become hoarse and tremulous, &#8220;ye got a thing on
your mind!&#8221;</p>
<p>I found him very old and ill and hopeless; &#8217;twas with
a shock that the thing came home to me: the man was
past all labor of the hands, got beyond all ships and
winds and fishing&ndash;&ndash;confronting, now, with an anxious
heart, God knows! a future of dependence, for life and
love, upon the lad he had nourished to the man that
was I. I remembered, again, the warning of that gray
personage who had said that my contempt would gather
at this hour; and I thought, as then I had in boyish
faith most truly believed, that I should never treat my
uncle with unkindness. &#8217;Twas very still and glowing
and beneficent upon the sea; &#8217;twas not an hour, thinks
I, whatever the prophecy concerning it, for any pain to
come upon us. My uncle was fallen back in a great
chair, on a patch of greensward overlooking the sea,
to which he had turned his face; and &#8217;twas a kindly
prospect that lay before his aged eyes&ndash;&ndash;a sweep of softest
ocean, walled with gentle, drifting cloud, wherein
were the fool&#8217;s great Gates, wide open to the glory
beyond.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m wishing, sir,&#8221; said I, &#8220;to wed Judith.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis a good hope,&#8221; he answered.</p>
<p>I saw his hand wander over the low table beside him:
I knew what it sought&ndash;&ndash;and that by his will and for my
sake it must forever seek without satisfaction.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir,&#8221; I implored, &#8220;I&#8217;ve no heart to ask her!&#8221;</p>
<p>He did not answer.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span></div>
<p>&#8220;And you know why, sir,&#8221; I accused him. &#8220;You
know why!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dannie,&#8221; says he, &#8220;ye&#8217;ve wished for this hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I am ready, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>He drew then from his pocket a small Bible, much
stained and wrinkled by water, which he put on the
table between us. &#8220;Dannie, lad,&#8221; says he, &#8220;do ye now
go t&#8217; your own little room, where ye was used t&#8217; lyin&#8217;,
long ago, when ye was a little lad.&#8221; He lifted himself
in the chair, turned upon me&ndash;&ndash;his eyes frankly wet.
&#8220;Do ye go there,&#8221; says he, &#8220;an&#8217; kneel, like ye used t&#8217;
do in the days when ye was but a little child, an&#8217; do ye
say, once again, for my sake, Dannie, the twenty-third
psa&#8217;m.&#8221;</p>
<p>I rose upon this holy errand.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;<i>The Lord is my shepherd,</i>&#8217;&#8221; my uncle repeated,
looking away to the fool&#8217;s great Gates, &#8220;&#8216;<i>I shall not
want.</i>&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>That he should not.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;<i>He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he
leadeth me beside the still waters.</i>&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>And so it should be.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dannie,&#8221; my uncle burst out, flashing upon me with
a twinkle, as when I was a lad, &#8220;I &#8217;low I&#8217;ve fetched ye
up very well: for say what ye will, &#8217;twas a wonderful
little anchor I give ye t&#8217; hold to!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>I went then to the little bed where as a child I lay
waiting for sleep to come bearing fairy dreams. &#8217;Twas
still and dusky in the room: the window, looking out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span>
upon the wide, untroubled waters, was a square of
glory; and the sea whispered melodiously below, as it
had done long, long ago, when my uncle fended my
childish heart from all the fears of night and day. I
looked out upon the waste of sea and sky and rock,
where the sombre wonder of the dusk was working,
clouds in embers, cliffs and water turning to shadows;
and I was comforted by this returning beauty. I repeated
the twenty-third psalm, according to my teaching,
reverently kneeling, as I was bid; and my heart
responded, as it has never failed to do. I remembered:
I remembered the windless dusks and fresh winds and
black gales through which as a child I had here serenely
gone to sleep because my uncle sat awake and watchful
below. I remembered his concern and diffident caresses
in the night when I had called to him to come: I remembered
all that he had borne and done to provide the happiness
and welfare he sought in loving patience to give
the child he had. Once again, as when I was a child,
the sea and sunset took my soul as a harp to stir with
harmonious chords of faith; and I was not disquieted
any more&ndash;&ndash;nor in any way troubled concerning the disclosure
of that black mystery in which I had thrived to
this age of understanding. And &#8217;twas in this mood&ndash;&ndash;this
grateful recollection of the multitudinous kindnesses
of other years&ndash;&ndash;that I got up from my knees to return to
my uncle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dannie,&#8221; says he, having been waiting, it seemed,
to tell me this, first of all, &#8220;ye&#8217;ll remember&ndash;&ndash;will ye
not?&ndash;&ndash;for your guidance an&#8217; comfort, that &#8217;tis not a tie
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span>
o&#8217; blood betwixt you an&#8217; ol&#8217; Nick Top. He&#8217;s no kin
t&#8217; shame ye: he&#8217;s on&#8217;y a chance acquaintance.&#8221;</p>
<p>The tale began at the waning of the evening
glory....</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&#8220;Your father an&#8217; me, lad,&#8221; said my uncle, &#8220;was shipmates
aboard the <i>Will-o&#8217;-the-Wisp</i> when she was cast
away in a nor&#8217;east gale on the Devil&#8217;s Teeth, near twenty
year ago: him bein&#8217; the master an&#8217; me but a hand
aboard. How old is you now, Dannie? Nineteen?
Well, well! You was but six months come from above,
lad, when that big wind blowed your father&#8217;s soul t&#8217; hell;
an&#8217; your poor mother was but six months laid away.
We was bound up from the Labrador that night, with
a cargo o&#8217; dry fish, picked up &#8217;long shore in haste, t&#8217; fill
out a foreign bark at Twillingate. &#8217;Twas late in the fall
o&#8217; the year, snow in the wind, the sea heapin&#8217; up in mountains,
an&#8217; the night as black as a wolf&#8217;s throat. Your
father was crowdin&#8217; on, Dannie, in the way he had, bein&#8217;
a wonderful driver, an&#8217; I &#8217;lowed he was fetchin&#8217; too close
t&#8217; the Harborless Shore for safety; but I wouldn&#8217;t tell un
so, lad, for I didn&#8217;t know un so well as I knows you,
bein&#8217; on&#8217;y a hand aboard, ye see, with a word or two t&#8217;
le&#8217;ward of what ye might call a speakin&#8217; acquaintance
with the skipper. I &#8217;lowed he&#8217;d strike the Rattler; but
he cleared the Rattler, by good luck, an&#8217; fetched up at
dawn on the Devil&#8217;s Teeth, a mean, low reef o&#8217; them
parts, where the poor <i>Will-o&#8217;-the-Wisp</i> broke her back
an&#8217; went on in splinters with the sea an&#8217; wind. &#8217;Twas
over soon, Dannie; &#8217;twas all over soon, by kindness o&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span>
Providence: the ol&#8217; craft went t&#8217; pieces an&#8217; was swep&#8217;
on t&#8217; le&#8217;ward by the big black waves.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the pause my uncle&#8217;s hand again searched the low
table for the glass that was not there.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not wantin&#8217; t&#8217; tell ye,&#8221; he muttered.</p>
<p>I would not beg him to stop.</p>
<p>&#8220;Me an&#8217; your father, Dannie,&#8221; he continued, presently,
dwelling upon the quiet sunset, now flaring with the
last of its fire, &#8220;somehow cotched a grip o&#8217; the rock.
&#8217;Twas a mean reef t&#8217; be cast away on, with no dry part
upon it: &#8217;twas near flush with the sea, an&#8217; flat an&#8217; broad
an&#8217; jagged, slimy with sea-weed; an&#8217; &#8217;twas washed over
by the big seas, an&#8217; swam in the low roll o&#8217; the black
ones. I &#8217;low, Dannie, that I was never afore cotched
in such a swirl an&#8217; noise o&#8217; waters. &#8217;Twas wonderful&ndash;&ndash;the
thunder an&#8217; spume an&#8217; whiteness o&#8217; them big waves
in the dawn! An&#8217; &#8217;twas wonderful&ndash;&ndash;the power o&#8217; them&ndash;&ndash;the
wolfish way they&#8217;d clutch an&#8217; worry an&#8217; drag!
&#8217;Twas a mean, hard thing t&#8217; keep a grip on that smoothed
rock; but I got my fingers in a crack o&#8217; the reef, an&#8217; managed
t&#8217; hold on, bein&#8217; stout an&#8217; able, an&#8217; sort of savage
for life&ndash;&ndash;in them old days. Afore long, your poor father
crep&#8217; close, lad, an&#8217; got his fingers in the same crack.
&#8217;Twas all done for you, Dannie, an&#8217; ye&#8217;ll be sure t&#8217; bear
it in mind&ndash;&ndash;will ye not?&ndash;&ndash;when ye thinks o&#8217; the man
hereafter. I seed the big seas rub un on the reef, an&#8217; cut
his head, an&#8217; break his ribs, as he come crawlin&#8217; towards
me. &#8217;Twas a long, long time afore he reached the place.
Ye&#8217;ll not forget it&ndash;&ndash;will ye lad?&ndash;&ndash;ye&#8217;ll surely not forget
it when ye thinks o&#8217; the man that was your father.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span></div>
<p>I looked at the sward, soft and green with summer,
and roundabout upon the compassionate shadows of
evening.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Nick,&#8217; says your father,&#8221; my uncle continued,
&#8220;&#8216;does ye hear them men?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;They was all gone down, poor souls! I knowed.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Nine men o&#8217; the crew,&#8217; says he, &#8216;drownin&#8217; there t&#8217;
le&#8217;ward.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twas o&#8217; Mary Luff&#8217;s son I thought, that poor lad!
for I&#8217;d fetched un on the v&#8217;y&#8217;ge.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I hear un callin&#8217;,&#8217; says he.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twas but a fancy: they was no voices o&#8217; them
drowned men t&#8217; le&#8217;ward.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Nick,&#8217; says he, &#8216;I didn&#8217;t mean t&#8217; wreck her here.
I was &#8217;lowin&#8217; t&#8217; strike the Long Cliff, where they&#8217;s a
chance for a man&#8217;s life. Does ye hear me, Nick?&#8217; says
he. &#8216;I didn&#8217;t mean t&#8217; do it <i>here</i>!&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Skipper,&#8217; says I, &#8216;was ye meanin&#8217; t&#8217; wreck that there
ship?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Not here,&#8217; says he.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Was ye meanin&#8217; t&#8217; <i>do</i> it?&#8217; says I.&#8221;</p>
<p>My uncle paused.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on, sir,&#8221; said I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dannie,&#8221; said he, &#8220;they come, then, three big seas,
as seas will; an&#8217; I &#8217;low&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;he touched the crescent scar&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;I
got this here about that time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas quite enough for me.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Skipper,&#8217; says I,&#8221; my uncle continued, &#8220;&#8216;what did
ye go an&#8217; do it for?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I got a young one t&#8217; St. John&#8217;s,&#8217; says he.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span></div>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8217;Tis no excuse,&#8217; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Ay,&#8217; says he, &#8216;but I was &#8217;lowin&#8217; t&#8217; make a gentleman
of un. He&#8217;s the on&#8217;y one I got,&#8217; says he, &#8217;an&#8217; his
mother&#8217;s dead.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8217;Twas no way t&#8217; go about it,&#8217; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Ye&#8217;ve no lad o&#8217; your own,&#8217; says he, &#8216;an&#8217; ye don&#8217;t
know. They was a pot o&#8217; money in this, Top,&#8217; says he.
&#8216;I was &#8217;lowin&#8217; t&#8217; make a gentleman o&#8217; my young one an
I lived through; but I got t&#8217; go&ndash;&ndash;I got t&#8217; go t&#8217; hell an&#8217;
leave un. They&#8217;s ice in these big seas,&#8217; says he, &#8216;an
I&#8217;ve broke my left arm, an&#8217; can&#8217;t stand it much longer.
But you&#8217;ll live it out, Top; you&#8217;ll live it out&ndash;&ndash;I knows
ye will. The wind&#8217;s gone t&#8217; the nor&#8217;west, an&#8217; the sea&#8217;s
goin&#8217; down; an&#8217; they&#8217;ll be a fleet o&#8217; Labrador craft up
the morrow t&#8217; pick you up. An&#8217; I was &#8217;lowin&#8217;, Top,&#8217;
says he, &#8216;that you&#8217;d take my kid an&#8217; fetch un up as his
mother would have un grow. They isn&#8217;t no one else t&#8217;
do it,&#8217; says he, &#8216;an&#8217; I was &#8217;lowin&#8217; you might try. I&#8217;ve
broke my left arm,&#8217; says he, &#8216;an&#8217; got my fingers froze,
or I&#8217;d live t&#8217; do it myself. They&#8217;s a pot o&#8217; money in
this, Top,&#8217; says he. &#8216;You tell the owner o&#8217; this here
ship,&#8217; says he, &#8216;an&#8217; he&#8217;ll pay&ndash;&ndash;he&#8217;ve got t&#8217; pay!&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had no wish for the task, Dannie&ndash;&ndash;not bein&#8217; much
on nursin&#8217; in them days.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I got t&#8217; go t&#8217; hell for this, Top,&#8217; says your father,
&#8216;an&#8217; I &#8217;lowed ye&#8217;d ease the passage.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Skipper, sir,&#8217; says I, &#8216;is ye not got a scrap o&#8217;
writin&#8217;?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;He fetched out this here little Bible.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Top,&#8217; says he, &#8216;I &#8217;lowed I&#8217;d have a writin&#8217; t&#8217; make
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span>
sure, the owner o&#8217; this here ship bein&#8217; on&#8217;y a fish speculator;
an&#8217; I got it in this Bible.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Then,&#8217; says I, &#8216;I&#8217;ll take that young one, Tom Callaway,
if I weathers this here mess.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Ay,&#8217; says he, &#8216;but I&#8217;m not wishin&#8217; t&#8217; go t&#8217; hell for
<i>that</i>.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twas come broad day now.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;An I&#8217;m but able, Tom Callaway,&#8217; says I, &#8216;I&#8217;ll make
a gentleman of un t&#8217; ease your pains.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Would ye swear it?&#8217; says he.</p>
<p>&#8220;I put my hand on the Book; an&#8217; I knowed, Dannie,
when I made ready t&#8217; take that oath, out there on the
Devil&#8217;s Teeth, that I&#8217;d give my soul t&#8217; hell for the
wickedness I must do. I done it with my eyes wide
open t&#8217; the burden o&#8217; evil I must take up; an&#8217; &#8217;twas
sort o&#8217; hard t&#8217; do, for I was by times a Christian man,
Dannie, in them ol&#8217; days, much sot on church an&#8217; prayer
an&#8217; the like o&#8217; that. But I seed that your poor father
was bent on makin&#8217; a gentleman out o&#8217; you t&#8217; please
your dead mother&#8217;s wishes, an&#8217; I &#8217;lowed, havin&#8217; no
young un o&#8217; my own, that I <i>didn&#8217;t</i> know much about the
rights of it; an&#8217; I knowed he&#8217;d suffer forever the pains
o&#8217; hell for what he done, whatever come of it, an&#8217; I
&#8217;lowed &#8217;twould be a pity t&#8217; have the murder o&#8217; seven
poor men go t&#8217; waste for want o&#8217; one brave soul t&#8217; face
the devil. &#8216;Nick,&#8217; thinks I, while your father, poor,
doomed man! watched me&ndash;&ndash;I can see here in the dusk
the blood an&#8217; water on his white face&ndash;&ndash;&#8216;Nick,&#8217; thinks I,
&#8216;an you was one o&#8217; them seven poor, murdered men,
ye&#8217;d want the price o&#8217; your life paid t&#8217; that wee young
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span>
one. From heaven or hell, Nick, accordin&#8217; t&#8217; which
place ye harbored in,&#8217; thinks I, &#8216;ye&#8217;d want t&#8217; watch that
little life grow, an&#8217; ye&#8217;d like t&#8217; say t&#8217; yourself, when
things went ill with ye,&#8217; thinks I, &#8216;that the little feller
ye died for was thrivin&#8217;, anyhow, out there on earth.&#8217;
An&#8217; I &#8217;lowed, for your wee sake, Dannie, an&#8217; for the
sake o&#8217; the seven poor, murdered men, whose wishes I
read in the dead eyes that looked into mine, an&#8217; for the
sake o&#8217; your poor, fond father, bound soon for hell, that
I&#8217;d never let the comfort o&#8217; my mean soul stand in the
way o&#8217; fetchin&#8217; good t&#8217; your little life out o&#8217; all this woe
an&#8217; wickedness. I &#8217;lowed, Dannie, then an&#8217; there, on
the Devil&#8217;s Teeth, that could I but manage to endure,
I&#8217;d stand by your little body an&#8217; soul t&#8217; the end, whatever
become o&#8217; me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas but a tale my uncle told: &#8217;twas not an extenuation&ndash;&ndash;not
a plea.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Tide&#8217;s risin&#8217;, Nick,&#8217; says your father. &#8216;I can&#8217;t
stand it much longer with my broken arm an&#8217; froze
fingers. Nick,&#8217; says he, &#8216;will ye swear?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was afraid, Dannie, t&#8217; swear it.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Won&#8217;t ye?&#8217; says he. &#8216;He&#8217;ve his mother&#8217;s eyes&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217;
he&#8217;ll be a wonderful good lad t&#8217; you.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t, Dannie.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;For God&#8217;s sake, Nick!&#8217; says he, &#8216;swear it, an&#8217; ease
my way t&#8217; hell.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I swear!&#8217; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Then,&#8217; says he, &#8216;you turn the screws on the owner
o&#8217; that there ship. The writin&#8217; is all you needs. You
make a gentleman o&#8217; my lad, God bless un! accordin&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span>
t&#8217; the wishes of his mother. Give un the best they is in
Newf&#8217;un&#8217;land. Nothin&#8217; too good in all the world for
Dannie. You bear in mind, Nick,&#8217; says he, &#8216;that I&#8217;m
roastin&#8217; in hell,&#8217; says he, &#8216;<i>payin</i>&#8217; for his education!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>My uncle&#8217;s hand approached the low table, but was
in impatience withdrawn; and the old man looked away&ndash;&ndash;northward:
to the place, far distant, where the sea
still washed the Devil&#8217;s Teeth.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve bore it in mind,&#8221; he muttered.</p>
<p>Ay! and much more than that: the wreck of his own
great soul upon my need had clouded twenty years of life
with blackest terror of the unending pains of perdition.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis a lovely evening, Dannie,&#8221; he sighed. &#8220;&#8217;Tis so
still an&#8217; kind an&#8217; beautiful. I&#8217;ve often &#8217;lowed, in weather
like this, with the sea at peace an&#8217; a red sky givin&#8217;
promise o&#8217; mercy for yet one day,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that I&#8217;d
like t&#8217; live forever&ndash;&ndash;jus&#8217; live t&#8217; fish an&#8217; be an&#8217; hope.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wisht ye might!&#8221; I cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; t&#8217; watch ye grow, Dannie,&#8221; said he, turning
suddenly upon me, his voice fallen low and tremulous
with affectionate feeling and pride. &#8220;Life,&#8221; says he, so
earnestly that I was made meek by the confession, &#8220;held
nothin&#8217; at all for me but the Christian hope o&#8217; heaven
until ye came; an&#8217; then, when I got ye, &#8217;twas filled full
o&#8217; mortal, unselfish, better aims. I&#8217;ve loved ye well,
lad, in my own delight,&#8221; says he. &#8220;I&#8217;ve loved ye in a
wishful way,&#8221; he repeated, &#8220;quite well.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was humble in this presence....</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&#8220;Your father,&#8221; my uncle resumed, &#8220;couldn&#8217;t stand
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span>
the big seas. I cotched un by the jacket, an&#8217; held un
with me, so long as I was able, though he &#8217;lowed I might
as well let un go t&#8217; hell, without drawin&#8217; out the fear o&#8217;
gettin there. &#8216;On&#8217;y a minute or two, Nick,&#8217; says he.
&#8216;Ye might as well let me get there. I&#8217;m cold, froze up,
an&#8217; they&#8217;s more ice comin&#8217; with this sea,&#8217; says he; &#8216;they
was a field o&#8217; small ice up along about the Sissors,&#8217; says
he, &#8216;an&#8217; I &#8217;low it haves come down with the nor&#8217;east
wind. The sea,&#8217; says he, &#8216;will be full of it afore long.
Ye better let me go,&#8217; says he. &#8216;&#8217;Tisn&#8217;t by any means
pleasant here, an&#8217; the on&#8217;y thing I wants, now that ye&#8217;ve
took the oath,&#8217; says he, &#8216;is t&#8217; get warm. Ye better let
me go. I got t&#8217; go, anyhow,&#8217; says he, &#8216;an&#8217; a hour or two
don&#8217;t make no difference.&#8217; An&#8217; so, with the babe that
was you in mind, an&#8217; with my life t&#8217; save for your sake,
I let un go t&#8217; le&#8217;ward, where the seven murdered men
had gone down drowned. &#8217;Twas awful lonesome without
un, when the tide got high an&#8217; the seas was mean
with chunks o&#8217; ice. Afore that,&#8221; my uncle intensely
declared, &#8220;I was admired o&#8217; water-side widows, on account
o&#8217; looks; but,&#8221; says he, touching his various disfigurements,
&#8220;I was broke open here, an&#8217; I was broke
open there, by bein&#8217; rubbed on the rocks an&#8217; clubbed
by the ice at high-tide. When I was picked up by
Tumm, o&#8217; the <i>Quick as Wink</i> (bein&#8217; bound up in fish),
I &#8217;lowed I might as well leave the cook, which is now
dead, have his way with the butcher-knife an&#8217; sail-needle;
an&#8217; so I come t&#8217; St. John&#8217;s as ye sees me now,
not a wonderful sight for looks, with my leg an&#8217; fingers
gone, but ready, God knows! t&#8217; stand by the young un
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_336' name='page_336'></a>336</span>
I was livin&#8217; t&#8217; take an&#8217; rear. Ye had been, all through
it, Dannie,&#8221; he added, simply, &#8220;the thing that made me
hold on; for when your father was gone t&#8217; le&#8217;ward, an&#8217;
I begun t&#8217; think o&#8217; ye, a wee babe t&#8217; St. John&#8217;s, I got t&#8217;
love ye, lad, as I&#8217;ve loved ye ever since.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis a lovely evening,&#8221; he added; &#8220;&#8217;tis a wonderful
civil and beautiful time, with all them clouds, like coals
o&#8217; fire, in the west.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas that: an evening without guile or menace&ndash;&ndash;an
hour most compassionate.</p>
<p>&#8220;The owner o&#8217; the <i>Will-o&#8217;-the-Wisp</i>,&#8221; says my uncle,
&#8220;wasn&#8217;t no Honorable in them days; he was but a St.
John&#8217;s fish speculator with a taste for low politics. But
he&#8217;ve become a Honorable since, on the fortune he&#8217;ve
builded from that wreck, an&#8217; he&#8217;s like t&#8217; end a knight o&#8217;
the realm, if he&#8217;ve money enough t&#8217; carry on an&#8217; marry
the widow he&#8217;s after. &#8217;Twas not hard t&#8217; deal with un&ndash;&ndash;leastways,
&#8217;twas not hard when I loaded with rum,
which I was used t&#8217; doin&#8217;, Dannie, as ye know, afore I
laid &#8217;longside of un in the wee water-side place he&#8217;d
fetch the money to. No, no! &#8217;Twas not easy: I&#8217;d not
have ye think it&ndash;&ndash;&#8217;twas hard, &#8217;twas bitter hard, Dannie, t&#8217;
be engaged in that dirty business. I&#8217;d not have ye black
your soul with it; an&#8217; I was &#8217;lowin, Dannie, afore the
parson left us, t&#8217; teach un how t&#8217; manage the Honorable,
t&#8217; tell un about the liquor an&#8217; the bluster, t&#8217; show un how
t&#8217; scare the Honorable on the Water Street pavement, t&#8217;
teach un t&#8217; threaten an&#8217; swear the coward&#8217;s money from
his pocket, for I wasn&#8217;t wantin&#8217; <i>you</i>, Dannie, t&#8217; know
the trial an&#8217; wickedness o&#8217; the foul deed, bein&#8217; in love
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_337' name='page_337'></a>337</span>
with ye too much t&#8217; have ye spoiled by sin. I &#8217;low I had
that there young black-an&#8217;-white parson near corrupted:
I &#8217;low I had un worked up t&#8217; yieldin&#8217; t&#8217; temptation, lad,
when he up an&#8217; left us, along o&#8217; Judy. An&#8217; there&#8217;s the
black-an&#8217;-white parson, gone God knows where! an&#8217;
here&#8217;s ol&#8217; Nick Top, sittin&#8217; on the grass at evenin&#8217;, laid
by the heels all along o&#8217; two days o&#8217; wind on the ice!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And so you brought me up?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, Dannie,&#8221; he answered, uneasily; &#8220;by blackmail
o&#8217; the Honorable. I got t&#8217; go t&#8217; hell for it, but I&#8217;ve
no regrets on that account,&#8221; says he, in a muse, &#8220;for
I&#8217;ve loved ye well, lad; an&#8217; as I sit here now, lookin&#8217;
back, I knows that God was kind t&#8217; give me you t&#8217; work
an&#8217; sin for. I&#8217;ll go t&#8217; hell&ndash;&ndash;ay, I&#8217;ll go t&#8217; hell! Ye must
never think, lad, when I gets down there, that I&#8217;m sorry
for what I done. I&#8217;ll not be sorry&ndash;&ndash;not even in hell&ndash;&ndash;for
I&#8217;ll think o&#8217; the years when you was a wee little lad,
an&#8217; I&#8217;ll be content t&#8217; remember. An&#8217; do you go away,
now, lad,&#8221; he added, &#8220;an&#8217; think it over. Ye&#8217;ll not judge
me now; ye&#8217;ll come back, afore long, an&#8217; then judge
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>I moved to go.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dannie!&#8221; he called.</p>
<p>I turned.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve gone an&#8217; tol&#8217; Judy,&#8221; says he, &#8220;lest she learn t&#8217;
love ye for what ye was not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas no matter to me....</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>This, then, was the heart of my mystery! I had been
fed and adorned and taught and reared in luxury by the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span>
murder of seven men and the merciless blackmail of an
ambitious villain. What had fed me, warmed me,
clothed me had been the product of this horrible rascality.
And my father was the murderer, whom I had
dreamed a hero, and my foster-father was the persecutor,
whom I had loved for his kindly virtue. And paid
for!&ndash;&ndash;all paid for in my father&#8217;s crime and damnation.
This&ndash;&ndash;all this&ndash;&ndash;to make a gentleman of the ill-born,
club-footed young whelp of a fishing skipper! I laughed
as I walked away from this old Nick Top: laughed to
recall my progress through these nineteen years&ndash;&ndash;the
proud, self-righteous stalking of my way.</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas a pretty figure I had cut, thinks I, with my
rings and London clothes, in the presence of the Honorable,
with whom I had dealt in pride and anger!
&#8217;Twas a pretty figure I had cut, all my life&ndash;&ndash;the whelp
of a ruined, prostituted skipper: the issue of a murderous
barratry! What protection had the defenceless
child that had been I against these machinations?
What protest the boy, growing in guarded ignorance?
What appeal the man in love, confronted by his origin
and shameful fostering? Enraged by this, what I
thought of my uncle&#8217;s misguided object and care I
may not here set down, because of the bitterness and
injustice of the reflections; nay, but I dare not recall
the mood and wicked resentment of that time.</p>
<p>And presently I came to the shore of the sea, where
I sat down on the rock, staring out upon the waters.
&#8217;Twas grown dark then, of a still, religious night, with
the black sea lapping the rocks, infinitely continuing in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_339' name='page_339'></a>339</span>
restlessness, and a multitude of stars serenely twinkling
in the uttermost depths of the great sky. &#8217;Twas of this
I thought, I recall, but cannot tell why: that the sea
was forever young, unchanging in all the passions of
youth, from the beginning of time to the end of it; that
the mountains were lifted high, of old, passionless, inscrutable,
of unfeeling snow and rock, dwelling above
the wish of the world; that the sweep of prairie, knowing
no resentment, was fruitful to the weakest touch; that
the forests fell without complaint; that the desert, hopeless,
aged, contemptuous of the aspirations of this day,
was of immutable bitterness, seeking some love long lost
to it nor ever to be found again; but that the sea was as
it had been when God poured it forth&ndash;&ndash;young and lusty
and passionate&ndash;&ndash;the only thing in all the fleeting world
immune from age and death and desuetude.</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas strange enough; but I knew, thank God! when
the rocking, crooning sea took my heart as a harp in its
hands, that all the sins and errors of earth were of
creative intention and most beautiful, as are all the
works of the God of us all. Nay, but, thinks I, the sins
of life are more lovely than the righteous accomplishments.
Removed by the starlit sky, wherein He dwells&ndash;&ndash;removed
because of its tender distance and beauty
and placidity, because of its compassion and returning
gift of faith, removed by the vast, feeling territory of
sensate waters, whereupon He walks, because they express,
eternally, His wrath and loving kindness&ndash;&ndash;carried
far away, in the quiet night, I looked back, and I understood,
as never before&ndash;&ndash;nor can I ever hope to know
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_340' name='page_340'></a>340</span>
again&ndash;&ndash;that God, being artist as we cannot be, had
with the life of the world woven threads of sin and error
to make it a pattern of supernal beauty, that His purpose
might be fulfilled, His eyes delighted.</p>
<p>And &#8217;twas with the healing of night and starry sky
and the soft lullaby of the sea upon my spirit&ndash;&ndash;&#8217;twas
with this wide, clear vision of life, the gift of understanding,
as concerned its exigencies&ndash;&ndash;that I arose and
went to my uncle....</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>I met Judith on the way: the maid was hid, waiting
for me, in the deep shadow of the lilacs and the perfume
of them, which I shall never forget, that bordered
the gravelled path of our garden.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve come at last,&#8221; says she. &#8220;He&#8217;ve been waiting
for you&ndash;&ndash;out there in the dark.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Judith!&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>She came confidingly close to me.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve a word to say to you, maid,&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; you&#8217;re a true man?&#8221; she demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis a word,&#8221; says I, &#8220;that&#8217;s between a man an&#8217; a
maid. &#8217;Tis nothing more.&#8221;</p>
<p>She held me off. &#8220;An&#8217; you&#8217;re true,&#8221; she demanded,
&#8220;to them that have loved you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As may or may not appear,&#8221; I answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Dannie,&#8221; she whispered, &#8220;I cannot doubt you!&#8221;</p>
<p>I remember the scent of the lilacs&ndash;&ndash;I remember the
dusk&ndash;&ndash;the starlit sky.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a word,&#8221; I repeated, &#8220;to say to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; what&#8217;s that?&#8221; says she.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_341' name='page_341'></a>341</span></div>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis that I wish a kiss,&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>She put up her dear red lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; says I, &#8220;but &#8217;tis a case of no God between us.
You know what I am and have been. I ask a kiss.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her lips still invited me.</p>
<p>&#8220;I love you, Judith,&#8221; says I, &#8220;and always have.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her lips came closer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would be your husband,&#8221; I declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kiss me, Dannie,&#8221; she whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;And there is no God,&#8221; says I, &#8220;between us?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no God,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;against us.&#8221;</p>
<p>I kissed her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll do it again, will you not?&#8221; says she.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll kiss your sweet tears,&#8221; says I. &#8220;I&#8217;ll kiss un
away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then kiss my tears.&#8221;</p>
<p>I kissed them away.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good,&#8221; says she; &#8220;that&#8217;s very good. An&#8217;
now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll speak with my uncle,&#8221; says I, &#8220;as you knowed
I would.&#8221;</p>
<p>I sought my uncle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir,&#8221; says I, &#8220;where&#8217;s the writing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis in your father&#8217;s Bible,&#8221; he answered.</p>
<p>I got it from the Book and touched a flaring match to
it. &#8220;&#8217;Tis the end of <i>that</i>, sir,&#8221; says I. &#8220;You an&#8217; me,
sir,&#8221; says I, &#8220;will be shipmates to the end of the voyage.&#8221;</p>
<p>He rose.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not able, sir,&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;I is!&#8221; he declared.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_342' name='page_342'></a>342</span></div>
<p>&#8217;Twas with difficulty he got to his feet, but he managed
it; and then he turned to me, though I could see
him ill enough in the dark.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dannie, lad,&#8221; says he, &#8220;I &#8217;low I&#8217;ve fetched ye up
very well. Ye is,&#8221; says he, &#8220;a&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; says I; &#8220;don&#8217;t say it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will!&#8221; says he.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t!&#8221; I pleaded.</p>
<p>&#8220;You <i>is</i>,&#8221; he declared, &#8220;a gentleman!&#8221;</p>
<p>The night and the abominable revelations of it were
ended for my uncle and me in this way....</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>And so it came about that the Honorable was troubled
no more by our demands, whatever the political necessities
that might assail him, whatever the sins of other
days, the black youth of him, that might fairly beset
and harass him. He was left in peace, to follow his career,
restored to the possessions my uncle had wrested
from him, in so far as we were able to make restitution.
There was no more of it: we met him afterwards, in
genial intercourse, but made no call upon his moneybags,
as you may well believe. My uncle and I made
a new partnership: that of Top &amp; Callaway, of which
you may have heard, for the honesty of our trade and
the worth of the schooners we build. He is used to
taking my hand, upon the little finger of which I still
wear the seal-ring he was doubtful of in the days when
Tom Bull inspected it. &#8220;A D for Dannie,&#8221; says he,
&#8220;an&#8217; a C for Callaway, an&#8217; betwixt the two,&#8221; says he,
&#8220;lyin&#8217; snug as you like, is a T for Top! An&#8217; that&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_343' name='page_343'></a>343</span>
the way I lies,&#8221; says he, &#8220;ol&#8217; Top betwixt the Dannie an&#8217;
the Callaway. An&#8217; as for the business in trade an&#8217;
schooners that there little ol&#8217; damned Chesterfieldian
young Dannie haves builded from a paddle-punt, with
Judy t&#8217; help un,&#8221; says he, &#8220;why don&#8217;t ye be askin&#8217; me!&#8221;
And the business I have builded is good, and the wife I
have is good, and the children are good. I have no
more to wish for than my uncle and wife and children.
&#8217;Tis a delight, when the day&#8217;s work is done, to sit at
table, as we used to do when I was a child, with the
geometrical gentleman framed in their tempestuous sea
beyond, and to watch my uncle, overcome by Judith&#8217;s
persuasion, in his old age, sip his dram o&#8217; hot rum.
The fire glows, and the maid approves, and my uncle,
with his ailing timber comfortably bestowed, beams
largely upon us.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jus&#8217; a nip,&#8221; says he. &#8220;Jus&#8217; a wee nip o&#8217; the best
Jamaica afore I goes t&#8217; bed.&#8221;</p>
<p>I pour the dram.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the stomach&#8217;s sake, Dannie,&#8221; says he, with a
gravity that twinkles against his will, &#8220;accordin&#8217; t&#8217; the
Apostle.&#8221;</p>
<p>And we are glad that he has that wee nip o&#8217; rum t&#8217;
comfort him....</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&#8217;Twas blowing high to-day. Tumm, of the <i>Quick as
Wink</i>, beat into harbor for shelter. &#8217;Twas good to know
that the genial fellow had come into Twist Tickle. I
boarded him. &#8217;Twas very dark and blustering and
dismally cold at that time. The schooner was bound
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_344' name='page_344'></a>344</span>
down to the French shore and the ports of the Labrador.
I had watched the clouds gather and join and forewarn
us of wind. &#8217;Twas an evil time for craft to be abroad,
and I was glad that Tumm was in harbor. &#8220;Ecod!&#8221;
says he, &#8220;I been up t&#8217; see the fool. They&#8217;ve seven,&#8221;
says he. &#8220;Ecod! think o&#8217; that! I &#8217;low Walrus Liz o&#8217;
Whoopin&#8217; Harbor got all she wanted. Seven!&#8221; cries he.
&#8220;Seven kids! Enough t&#8217; stock a harbor! An&#8217; they&#8217;s
talk o&#8217; one o&#8217; them,&#8221; says he, &#8220;bein&#8217; trained for a
parson.&#8221; I think the man was proud of his instrumentality.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve jus&#8217; come from the place,&#8221; says he,
&#8220;an&#8217; he&#8217;ve seven, all spick an&#8217; span,&#8221; says he, &#8220;all
shined an&#8217; polished like a cabin door-knob!&#8221; I had
often thought of it, and now dwelt upon it when I left
him. I remembered the beginnings of our lives, and
I knew that out of the hopelessness some beauty had
been wrought, in the way of the God of us all: which
is the moral of my tale.</p>
<p>&#8220;Think o&#8217; that!&#8221; cries Tumm, of the <i>Quick as Wink</i>.</p>
<p>I did think of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Think o&#8217; that!&#8221; he repeated.</p>
<p>I had left Tumm below. I was alone. The night
was still black and windy; but of a sudden, as I looked
up, the clouds parted, and from the deck of the <i>Quick
as Wink</i> I saw, blind of vision as I was, that high over
the open sea, hung in the depth and mystery of space,
there was a star....</p>
